    a wide array of subjects related to antiquity across the globe, focusing on lithic

    early seafaring, Native American topics, landscape studies, 
    archaeology, archaeoastronomy, petroglyphs, comparative religion, 
    history, megaliths, mythology, and ancient civilizations.

    You can reserve books now for pick-up at the next conference, or we can arrange for some other way
    to get the books to you.  But note that some of the books in our collection are non-circulating,
    even though they may currently be listed as "Available".
  </p>
  <p>
    The move to the space in Nashua means we are deaccessioning some duplicate and extraneous titles.
    These books and videos will be offered for sale to members online and at conferences.
    To see the collection of books that we are deaccessioning, look at the list of 
    <a href="https://www.librarycat.org/lib/NEARA.Library/search/text/%28+tags%3A+sell+AND+NOT+tags%3A+missing+%29+" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NEARA Library books for sale</a>.
    This list will be updated occasionally, so come back to see what new books have been added to it.
    Look for the tag "sell" -- although some books might have already been sold but mistakenly still remain on this list.
    You can reserve books now for purchase at the next conference, or we can arrange for some other way
    to get the books to you.

  <h2 id="Archives">Archives</h2>
  <p>
    NEARA's Archives include many documents of the organization, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Site Files</i>: reports describing various interesting sites in the northeast.</li>
    <li><i>People Files</i>: personal notes and correspondence of many prominent NEARA researchers.</li>
    <li><i>Subject Files</i>: various published articles and passages about a very wide variety of subjects.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We are in the midst of digitizing the NEARA Archives.
    If you are a member of NEARA you can see photos and some
    of the documents at <a href="https://sitedb.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SiteDB.org</a>.

    Due to the sensitive nature of many of the documents, such as the Site Reports, we have limited access to them.
    Tell us what research you want to do.  If we do not know you well, it would help to get the support of a member
    of the Board of Directors, such as a Chapter Coordinator.
