  <h1>What does NEARA do?</h1>
  <p>
    Observant visitors to America's northeastern forests have long encountered various stone 
    structures. These include rock piles, stone chambers, unusual stone walls and circles,
    propped boulders, standing stones, petroglyphs, and stone or earthen 
    mounds. NEARA was founded in 1964 to promote research into the origins 
    and functions of these structures and sites, to document them and 
    encourage their protection and preservation. Volunteers participate in 
    the search for new sites and enjoy the challenge of better understanding 
    them through the lenses of history, archaeology, anthropology and 
    geology, as well as fields such as archaeoastronomy, deed research, and 
    epigraphy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our semiannual meetings provide an opportunity for sharing research on a wide array of 
    subjects, from the early peopling of the Americas, diffusion of cultural 
    features across oceans in antiquity, Native American traditions, to the 
    colonial period. Mythology, astronomy, comparative religion, 
    agricultural practices, landscape studies and remote sensing are all 
    areas we have explored. Our meetings and publications offer a forum for 
    studying these diverse subjects, in an effort to better understand our 
    region and its global context.

    It's the Newport Tower, right?
  </p>
  <p>
    No, it's the Lakeville Massachusetts Sailors' Home Tower, built in 1882.
    Note the central support for its use as a water tower, not a windmill.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks to Lisa Allen for telling us about the tower.
    Dedicated Fall 2025 Conference field trip participants visited it in the rain and darkness
    after visiting other sites in Middleborough and Lakeville.

  <h2 id="SandwichNH">A Field Trip to Sandwich New Hampshire</h2>
  <p>
    Devon Toland led a field trip to investigate a site report of two mortar stones
    and an oddly shaped stone with a legend, both in Sandwich NH.
    Several sources describe these stones, and give us a look into the surrounding area's history.
  </p>

  <h3>Squam Rock</h3>
  <p>
    Legend has it that an Abenaki woman named Suneta was struck by lightning out on Squam Lake and
    turned into this spectacle of a rock. The rock was relocated from the cove to the landowners
    front lawn, until it was moved to its third location, at the Sandwich NH Historical Society.
  </p>
  <blockquote>A LEGEND OF BIG SQUAM LAKE</blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <i>From “Indians of New Hampshire” by Eva A Speare 1965
    One of the many indentations of the shore of Big Squam Lake bears the name of Squam Cove.
    The place was marked for many years by a granite boulder that resembled a crouching woman.
    Many years ago an aged Indian chief possessed this shore and, wishing a young bride to keep
    his wigwam, he selected Suneta for whom he traded with her father.</i>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <i>Suneta loved a young brave, Anonis, and communicated to him her danger, but her lover did not
    appear in time to prevent the wedding with the aged chief.
    In accordance with Indian customs, the wedding was celebrated with much feasting which so
    wearied the old Indian that after the festivities were finished, he lay down for a needed rest and
    fell fast asleep.</i>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <i>Meanwhile over the lake a sudden storm arose.
    Suneta sat alone in the wigwam, sad and disappointed. In the darkness of the storm she saw
    her lover entering and beckoning her to follow him to the lake. As the two were hurrying to
    escape, the chief awoke. Instantly, he drew his bow and killed Anonis.
    When she saw her lover fall, Suneta ran to the shore and crouching in the storm, prayed to the
    Great Spirit to make an example of her plight for all women to see. After the storm had passed,
    on the shore was seen the figure of Suneta turned to granite and to this day this stone has been
    called Squam Rock.</i>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Indian Mortars</h3>
  <p>
    From the book <i>Sandwich New Hampshire 1763-1990</i> by the Sandwich Historical Society:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <i>The New Hampshire Native Americans-Abenakis, Pequakets, Ossipees tended to move about.
    One site in Sandwich registered with the state is a spot near the foot of Burleigh Hill where the Natives may have spent some time.
    Here Indian mortars - indentations in the rock used to pulverize vegetable material have been discovered.
    In this area the mortars were probably used to grind nuts or acorns.</i>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <i>This site is unusual in two respects:
    it is in an upland area just two miles from Squam Lake on a direct route from Holderness;
    and there are two mortars together, the only such site found in the state to date.
    One mortar has pounding scars indicating the use of the pestle, but so far none has been found.</i>

  <h2 id="FalseAccusations">False Accusations</h2>
  <p>
    A recent Facebook post by Mike Luoma implied that NEARA “tolerates Neo-Nazis”.
    This assertion was made in reaction to a field trip announcement that referenced a magazine article
    for the purpose of debunking the claims made in that article.
    Because the magazine cited was edited by someone known to be a Neo-Nazi,
    Mike Luoma accused NEARA of tolerating Neo-Nazis.
  </p>
  <p>
    NEARA does not condone or tolerate behavior that is supportive of Neo-Nazi, white supremacist, or racist views.
    At no time did any member of the NEARA Board of Directors endorse the views of Francis Joseph Collin.
  </p>
  <p>
    In fact the private email to NEARA members that referenced a decades-old article in Collin’s magazine was
    there for the explicit purpose of debunking the claim made there that a site was a 5th Century church.
    NEARA believes that it is important to examine the evidence behind claims made about old stone structures.
    In this case, the field trip will actually show the evidence contradicting those claims.
    We believe that the best way to counter false claims is to hold them up to the light.

  <h2 id="Forum">Announcing the NEARA Forum</h2>
  <p>
    Long ago NEARA members were able to communicate with each other in a private Yahoo Group.
    We would like to revive such a forum, this time as a private Google Group.
    If you are interested, membership is open to all members of NEARA in good standing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Read about the details at <a href="/forum.html">The NEARA Forum</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is another in a sequence of initiatives to provide more services and information to NEARA members,
    following introduction of <a href="/calendar.html">The NEARA Calendar</a>.

  <h2>NEARA Organization Changes</h2>
  <p>
    We are in the process of making some changes to how NEARA is structured.
  </p>
  <p>
    The NEARA Member Communications Committee includes not only the old Membership Committee,
    but also many other roles/groups that have substantial interactions with members.
    Unlike the Publications Committee, Member Communications subcommittees and roles will
    primarily communicate via the internet.
  </p>
  <p>
    The First Vice President's many roles are now more explicitly spelled out,
    in the hopes of encouraging more people to help stage our conferences.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can see how NEARA is organized from the point of view of a typical NEARA member at:
