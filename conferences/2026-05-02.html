  <h2>Spring 2026 Conference</h2>

  <p>
    MEARA wo;; be holding the Spring 2026 NEARA Conference, including the Annual General Meeting,
    online via Zoom on May 2nd.  The Zoom meeting is just a part of a series of exciting events
    happening across the northeast from April through June.  Join us at as many events as you can.
  </p>
  <p>
    We had originally reserved Camp Wightman in North Stonington CT for the spring conference,
    but that reservation fell through, and we were not able to find an available venue for late April
    in both quality and price in that area.
    Hence the decision to hold the Annual General Meeting and have talks via Zoom.
    The big benefit is that you won't incur any hotel room costs, nor will you be paying for the
    hotel meeting costs (hall and food).
  </p>
  <p>
    But we really want people to get together, so field trips will also occur at various locations in the northeast.
    And we have decided to extend the nature of conference-related events to include activities beyond the usual field trips.
  </p>
