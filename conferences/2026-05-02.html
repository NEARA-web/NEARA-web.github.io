  <h2>Spring 2026 Conference</h2>

  <p>
    The Spring 2026 NEARA Conference, including the Annual General Meeting,
    will be held virtually via Zoom on May 2nd.
    Field trips and other events will take place on other days.
  </p>
  <p>
    We had originally reserved Camp Wightman in North Stonington CT for the spring conference,
    but that reservation fell through, and we were not able to find an available venue for late April
    in both quality and price in that area.
    Hence the decision to hold the Annual General Meeting and have talks via Zoom.
    The big benefit is that you won't incur any hotel room costs, nor will you be paying for the
    hotel meeting costs (hall and food).
  </p>
  <p>
    But we really want people to get together, so field trips will also occur at various locations in the northeast.
    And we have decided to extend the nature of conference-related events to include activities beyond the usual field trips.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are working on the slate of presenters and the field trips and other events.
    More information should be arriving soon.
  </p>
  <h3 id="SpeakerSuggestions">Future Speakers</h3>
  <p>
    It takes a lot of work to assemble a good program for a conference.
    We would like it if all NEARA members would give us their suggestions for speakers who they would like to see.
    So we have created a form for you to fill out for each person you recommend:
    <a href="https://forms.gle/6nav6L8gg8ZEJmsZ8 " target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suggest a Speaker</a>
