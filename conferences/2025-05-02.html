  <h2>Spring 2025 Conference</h2>

  <h4>May 2 to 4 near Fishkill, NY</h4>
  <p>
    The Spring 2025 NEARA Conference will be held at
    <a href="https://freshair.org/rent-our-facilities/" target="_blank">Sharpe Reservation's Camp Mariah</a>,
    near Fishkill New York on the first weekend of May.
  </p>
  <p>
    The relaxed setting of Camp Mariah in the Sharpe Reservation in the Hudson Valley
    offers an ideal atmosphere to share presentations, meals, walks, and informal conversations.
    Whether new to NEARA or a long-time member, the Spring 2025 conference is an opportunity to visit new sites,
    learn and share new insights, and make new acquaintances or reconnect with old ones. 
  </p>
  <p>
