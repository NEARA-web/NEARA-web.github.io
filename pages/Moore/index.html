An incalculable number of boulders were left in the wake of great shields of ice 
retreating northward during the last glacial epoch.&nbsp; A great number of these 
came to rest on bedrock surfaces as 'perched' boulders. Some of these are 
&quot;foreigners&quot; in the sense that they are a different bedrock unit than the native 
rock on which they lay. However, some came to rest in positions of a more 
precarious nature that caught the eye and imagination of early inhabitants from 
the Native Americans down to more modern day colonial settlers.&nbsp; Even before 
glacial theories became fact these rocks were oft times discussed amongst early 
geologists such as Amherst's Edward Hitchcock in his two treatises on 
Massachusetts's geology from 1835 and 1841.&nbsp; Hitchcock mused about the great 
quantities of water necessary to move such large rocks and wrote, &quot;bowlders are 
by far the most instructive index of diluvial agency in Massachusetts.&quot;<br>
<br>
The six sites discussed represent what I arbitrarily feel show the more 
exemplary examples of these features.&nbsp; Size, minimum point of contact, and how 
the rock might be tipped are the considerations I used in rocks that demonstrate 
the effect/illusion of being balanced.&nbsp; Indeed, early histories record these 
rocks as being capable of some limited movement thus gaining names such as 
Tipping Rock, Rolling Rock, Teetering Rock, etc. In almost all the cases I have 
personally observed, no movement was possible in the present time.&nbsp; 
Additionally, I have a couple of examples of 'doublets' or boulders upon a 
boulder that represent their own unique form of a balancing act.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
If one were to try and select one example for its characteristics and fame as a 
rock, it would be Lanesborough's Balance Rock. This 165-ton boulder sits on a 
relatively small point of rock that is said to be the tip of another, already 
deposited and buried, erratic.&nbsp; Indeed, Balance Rock is only one of many 
erratics deposited in this section of forest that was pastureland up until the 
middle part of the 1900s.&nbsp; Indian legends explain the occurrence of the boulders 
as a game of quoits and local history tells of a band of gypsies moving in on 
the field of the former farmer owner and charging admission to see the Rock. 
Although this boulder is oblong in nature, observing - or more especially 
photographing it from the end view, only serves to enhance the effect it is just 
barely sitting upon a very small point of rock.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
Up in the northwest environs of Worcester County lies a rock, or more accurately 
two of them, whose prominence may equal that of the Lanesborough Balance Rock.&nbsp; 
Known variously as Tipping Rock, Rocking Stone, and sometimes better known as 
Cradle Rock, this double set of boulders does actually sit quite close to the 
edge of a ledge of bedrock.&nbsp; Native Americans were familiar with the site as 
well as countless others including preeminent Massachusetts geologist Edward 
Hitchcock from the 1800s and glacial geologist William Alden from the early 
1900s. It said that years ago a previous owner/farmer, tiring of trespassers, 
affixed the two boulders so they would not rock anymore.&nbsp; Another version of the 
story shows a more compassionate farmer by relating the story that the boulders 
were fixed so they would not fall off the ledge.</p>

Fall River's Rolling Rock, on the other hand, sits right in a section of urban 
sprawl.&nbsp; This rock was preserved by the City in 1930 culminating a 25 year 
battle to decide it's fate.&nbsp; It's estimated weight is 140 tons and can 
considered a 'true' erratic in that it is a conglomerate boulder (most likely 
from the Dighton area) sitting upon a base rock of granite.&nbsp; Native Americans 
were said to exact punishment from guilty parties by 'rolling' the rock upon the 
victims' limbs that had been placed underneath the edges.&nbsp; As early as the 
1840s, geologist Hitchcock expressed concerned that a nearby quarry might lead 
to the ultimate demise of Rolling Rock.&nbsp; But by the 1860s the quarry foreman 
brought stability to the rock by shimming it up and preventing further motion.</p>

<b>Balance Rock, Wachusetts Mt.</b></p>

<br>
Balance Rock on the northern slopes of Wachusetts Mountain is another fine 
example of a double boulder formation.&nbsp; Resting on a gently sloping bedrock 
surface, it is easily accessible from (what else?) the Balanced Rock Trail. In 
olden days when summit houses, offering rooms and amenities, use to grace the 
mountain's top one brochure describes &quot;Double Boulder&quot; as &quot;a curiosity of nature 
located on the northerly slopes of the Mountain, on the line of the old Indian 
Trail.&nbsp; It consists of two immense boulders having one upon the other, the upper 
one so firmly placed in position as to be immovable, they are each about six 
feet in diameter and together weigh in the vicinity of thirty tons.&quot;<br>

<b>Balance Rock, Worcester County</b></p>
  <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<br>
On private land in the suburbs of Worcester lies a Balance Rock with a little 
bit of an unusual nature: The fulcrum - or pivot point - in the &quot;balancing act&quot; 
lies on the boulder itself.&nbsp; Lying high upon an elevated exposure of bedrock, 
its very slight movement was demonstrated by the landowner himself.&nbsp; Several 
more historical names for this rock edifice were Dog's Head and the Old Poet.</p>

<font face="arial,helvetica"><br>
</font>Further out of Worcester, on the border with Middlesex County, lies a 
rock that captures the essence of all that makes for a good balanced rock.&nbsp; This 
oblong boulder lies across the edge of a small outcrop of rock that makes for a 
small ledge.&nbsp; Not only this, but it is tipped in what one might call a very 
&quot;insecure&quot; position looking as if it might want to fall.&nbsp; But as one local law 
enforcement officer told me, stories abound concerning this rock including 
attempts by local school children to push it off its pedestal.&nbsp; Indeed, 
Hitchcock describes it as &quot;a bowlder of granite, 17 feet long and 27 feet in 
circumference, resting upon granite or gneiss: apparently just ready to fall, 
and yet five men with levers were unable to throw it from its base.&quot;</p>

</font>Certainly the discussion of Balanced Rocks might be carried on for some 
time but I am going to conclude it with an entry into the &quot;honorable mention&quot; 
category.&nbsp; At <a href="http://members.aol.com/BerkMtnMan/eastrockhist.jpg" target="_blank">East 
Rock</a> in Great Barrington lays a double boulder formation that seems to have 
received little recognition outside of its own local area and history.&nbsp; As late 
as the early 1900s it was written &quot;you can tip it back and forth by one 
finger.&quot;&nbsp; Whether movement in East Rock is still possible, I will leave up to 
some very strong-armed future explorer to discover. <br>
