<h2>Rock-on-Rock</h2>
<p>
One of the loveliest and most suggestive things
to find in the woods is a single rock placed on top of another. It
stands out, like an exclamation
point, visible from a distance.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes rock-on-rocks appear grouped together near the edge of a
wetland; or perhaps you will see a dozen of them spread
thinly
across the slopes of a hill. This indicates systematic rather than
random construction and implies an organized function. I find evidence
for several possible functions. They might mark a
trail, designate a boundary, or create a sense of
enclosure
around a natural feature like a spring. They often signal the presence
of other
stone constructions nearby. Here is the evidence for these and some
other possibilities.
</p>

<h4>Marking a trail</h4>
<p>
In the book <i>Animal Tracks and
Hunter's Signs</i> (1), Ernest Thompson Seton tells us that Indians
used rock-on-rock to mark a trail.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="RockOnRock/HuntersSignsSmall.jpg">
</figure>
<p>
There is some evidence for this around here. Here is a large
rock-on-rock located in
a gully between two summits of a hill in
Littleton.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="RockOnRock/ProctorLargeRockOnRock.jpg">
  <img src="RockOnRock/ProctorWedged.jpg">
</figure>
<p>
A few feet away is a split-wedged
rock. Both features occur near the high point of the gully. The large
rock-on-rock is certainly an
interesting artifact. It would
take significant effort to lift the upper rock into place and, from
the evidence of the thin stone shims wedging it in place, it was
intended to stay in this exact position. It appears to mark the
beginning of a trail. Exploring nearby, I found
what seemed to be a faint trail running off uphill from this spot. In
the
next picture, looking up the trail, you can see another
rock-on-rock and can just make
out one more higher up the slope. This faint trail leads over the hill,
down
into another gully with more rock-on-rock markers, back up another
slope, and then disappears at the
edge of a housing development.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
How could a trail remain after all these years of farming,
pasturing, logging and other disturbances? Possibly a
small amount of logging
and pasturing would not necessarily destroy everything. But on the
other hand the
trail might be recent.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes
rock-on-rocks, by themselves, point
towards
something interesting.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="RockOnRock/PileatedLastRockOnRock.jpg">
</figure>
<p>
This one from Boxborough is arrowhead shaped and points towards the
left in the picture. It indicates a hilltop covered with large glacial
erratics
and rock piles. I have had
good luck following such clues.
</p>

<h4>Designating Boundaries</h4>
<p>
Rock-on-rocks are frequently found at the periphery of larger sites of
more substantial rock piles, so it is artificial
to
consider them in isolation. But it is instructive. Here is a location
in Acton with many rock piles near a spring. In the picture, the spring
is
in the
background with lusher growth.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="RockOnRock/naghi.jpg">
</figure>
<p>
There are several
rock-on-rocks along the edge. They appear to act like a fence or
boundary, however this could be a matter of where
larger
rocks happened to be available as supports, or possibly simply that the
rock-on-rocks are grouped near the spring.
</p>

<h4>Creating a sense of Enclosure</h4>
<p>
It is likely that some groups of nearby rock-on-rocks are enclosing a
space. In
the next picture from Northfield MA, a rock-on-rock in the foreground
and one in the
background
seem to enclose the moist spot in between, which is a spring. In the
next picture, from Littleton's Long Pond Conservation Land, three
or more rock-on-rocks are grouped together.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="RockOnRock/NFLdSpring.jpg">
  <img src="RockOnRock/LongPondCartPath2.jpg">
</figure>
<p>
Examples like these suggest an inter-relationship if not an enclosure.
Instead of enclosing a feature of interest they may be signaling it,
helping to decorate it, to enhance it, or to dramatize
it. You may see rock-on-rocks around a spring. You may also see them
around a large boulder, or arranged around some other stone
construction.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="RockOnRock/CobbPathQuartzOnRock.jpg">
</figure>
<p>
In this context it is very
interesting that one almost never sees a rock-on-rock made of quartz.
The only examples I have seen were near a
well traveled path in Littleton. If it is true that quartz was used as
a window or transmitter then it would not be a suitable material for
creating an enclosure, or a barrier, or a focus around something else.
</p>

<h4>Wetland groupings and possible alignments</h4>
<p>
Sometimes many rock-on-rocks will be found in the same area with two or
three visible at a time. Typically this happens where it is both
wet and rocky. For example, they
are almost crowded in one place at Wolf Swamp in Boxborough and there
are similar wetlands in Acton, Stow, and Littleton.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="RockOnRock/WolfRR3.jpg"> 
  <img src="RockOnRock/WolfRR10.jpg">
  <img src="RockOnRock/WolfRR4.jpg">
</figure>
<p>
I am told [Tim Fohl,
private communication about Wolf Swamp] that in several instances two
or more of the rock-on-rocks form a line that is pointing towards a
solstice. This suggests yet another possible function for groups of
rock-on-rocks: they could be forming an alignment.
</p>
<p>
Another example which supports the idea that a rock-on-rock may be part
of an alignment is when the rock is in an awkward and un-natural
position, held in place by shims. There are several examples of this
and it might be a requirement for an alignment, whereas it is hard to
imagine it being needed for the other functions described here.
</p>

<h4>Rock-on-Rocks on a hillside</h4>
<p>
On several hills in Acton, Boxborough, and Harvard, there are many
rock-on-rocks overall, but not grouped together. These next ones are on
a hill in Harvard. It is possible that the
shape or coloring of each one is significant.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="RockOnRock/MetacomRonR1.jpg">
  <img src="RockOnRock/MetacomRonR2.jpg">
  <img src="RockOnRock/MetacomRonR3Burnt.jpg">
  <img src="RockOnRock/MetacomRonR4.jpg">
  <img src="RockOnRock/MetacomRonR5.jpg">
  <img src="RockOnRock/MetacomRonR6.jpg">
</figure>
<p>
There are probably
many more hills like this further west. They might have been orchards
or pastures and their slopes may never have been plowed. I am confident
there are many thousands of rock-on-rock to be seen there. As to how
features like these could have remained un-damaged over time: possibly
the land owners themselves or their workers created the
structures.
</p>

<h4>Rock-on-rock as representations</h4>
<p>
This first picture, from Carlisle, suggests a birdlike shape. The
shaped rock is obvious. If we are inquiring into the intent
of making a rock
pile, something like this should not be ignored.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="RockOnRock/BantaDRonRBIrd.jpg">
  <img src="RockOnRock/FHRRR2.jpg">
  <img src="RockOnRock/FHRRR.jpg">
</figure>
<p>
Making the case for representation still
more strongly are two
examples of rock-on-rock-on-rock
found next to each
other, in Boxborough near Flagg Hill.
Both have an upper rock with a
delicate spike sticking out one end. Found a few feet apart, it cannot
be a coincidence that they
have the same odd shape. Other shapes occur which are not bird-like.
</p>
<p>
Also, in addition to suggestive single shapes, there are examples
with a shape parallelism between upper and lower rocks.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="RockOnRock/FlaggBack1.jpg">
  <img src="RockOnRock/NFlaggRonRParallel.jpg">
</figure>
<p>
These
could be a coincidence or could be
intentional. Certainly the "cashew" shape, in the first picture, is
very common and often occurs in pairs.
</p>

<h4>Beauty of Rock-on-Rock</h4>
<p>
Rock-on-rocks have a
special aesthetic quality of their own. They are so simple. They are
easy to see in most
weather and it is nice to see them when you are out exploring.
</p>

</figure>

<h4>In the snow</h4>
<p>
They are particularly charming in the snow, especially when you
cannot see the rock-on-rock but know it is there.
</p>

</figure>

<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>
Whenever the question arises about how rock-on-rocks could be ancient
and not
disturbed, the answer is that they may <i>not</i> be ancient. Some could
be old but clearly some are recent. For example,
from the woods along Rt 28 in Falmouth, a
rounded bowl shaped flake of rock spalled off of a rock, was
turned upside down and placed back on top. This is so precarious and
there is no
debris buildup around it, how old could
it be? Probably not very old. If these artifacts are Native American,
they suggest an ongoing relationship and use of the woods by Indians.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Whatever their age or how they could have survived in a landscape so
thoroughly used, rock-on-rocks are quite common in eastern
Massachusetts and I am told [Norman Muller, private communication] they
are also found in Vermont and Pennsylvania. There are several
hypotheses about how they could
have been used and what was their intent. Aside from the idea of
representing a figure like a bird, there is some evidence they were
used
to mark a boundary or indicate a barrier. Their use for
marking a trail is less common.
</p>
<p>
Over time, one hopes to have a better understanding of rock-on-rocks
and
whether they have one function or many different functions. Becoming
aware of them, they become easy to see. For me, it is always
encouraging to see one through
the bushes or a distance away - usually the first sign I am approaching
a site with other interesting features.
