<h2>Rock Pile Site Distribution</h2>

<p>This map is a composite of the Maynard,
Billerica, Ayer, and Hudson quadrangle maps from the US Geographical
Survey. It shows a portion of Middlesex and Worcester counties of
Massachusetts. During the years
from 1998 to the present, in 2005, I explored systematically in this
area locating rock pile sites. Major
rivers and brooks are shown in blue. The Sudbury River in the south and
the Assabet River in the west, join to form the Concord River which
flows northeast.

<h4>Sampling Method and Percent of Coverage</h4>
<p>
The topographic map was used to identify forested areas, which were
then explored. I learned that rock pile sites are most often found
where hills meet water. This made it more efficient to find sites where
these conditions were met but,
over time, I also looked in other areas.
</p>
<p>
The topographical maps are divided into 1000x1000 meter square units.
A count of the number of units visited versus the total number gives an
estimate of the percentage of the region that has been explored. It is
worth distinguishing
between forested and un-forested units. Typical un-forested units are
ones with residential or commercial zoning. Visiting un-forested
units was not a priority and, in many cases, was not possible because
of limited access to private property. Some example
tallies are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>For Concord, north of the Concord River: (#units visited /
#units) = 13/14 (forested) and 8/11 (un-forested)</li>
  <li>For Concord, between the Assabet and Sudbury Rivers: 7/11
(forested) and 7/12 (un-forested)</li>
  <li>For Lincoln we have 15/19 (forested) and 2/21 (un-forested) -
[because of the large amount of private property]</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other parts of the region have similar tallies. North of the
rivers the coverage for forested units was around <b>75%</b> or better, while
south of the rivers the coverage for forested units was closer to <b>63%</b>.
The large number of
private estates, and small amount of conservation land in places like
Lincoln, substantially reduce the coverage and correspondingly reduce
the information available for such towns.
</p>
<p>
I have explored outwards from Concord but not equally in all
directions. I have not
finished exploring in Sudbury, Natick, and
other towns to the south. To the east, inside Route 128, there are
fewer conservation lands and too few forested units. So sites are
under-represented in these
directions. This explains some of the difference between the upper and
lower parts
of the map, however I believe the uneven site distribution reflects a
real difference in land use, not just a difference in sampling.
</p>

<h4>Site Groupings and Watersheds</h4>
<p>
Let me call attention to three groups of sites on the map.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The largest group crosses the map from upper right to lower left
corresponding with
brooks flowing
south into the Assabet River. This region is what geologists call the
Nashoba Uplift.
  </li>
  <li>A second smaller group of sites appears along Hobbs Brook in
Lincoln, Lexington, and Weston. More sites, further down the watershed
(of the Charles River), are off the map to the south.</li>
  <li>A third group is located along brooks flowing into the Sudbury
River.
More sites on this watershed are off the map to the south.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
There are very few sites between the Assabet and the Sudbury. Although more
exploration is certainly possible in this area, essentially no rock
piles have been found there.
</p>

<h4>Site discovery rate and the Learning Curve</h4>
<p>
More than
140 sites have been found. Here is a trend chart of number of sites
found per month.
At the beginning I located one or two new sites per month. Later,
during
the summer of 2004, after learning how to locate them, they were found
at a rate as high as three a week. The monthly information was not
properly recorded
pre-2000 or from June
2002 - June2003 so there are anomalies in the chart around Jul-98 and
Jul-02.
In spite of this, the increase over time is clear and suggests a
learning curve.
</p>
<figure>

<p>
The presence of the learning curve makes sense - I was learning how to
identify certain combinations of features on the topo maps before going
out to explore, and also was learning where to look once there, in the
woods.
</p>

<h4>Typical site locations</h4>
<p>
Careful examination of the details of the map above
show how the sites are related to hills and water. In particular, the
majority of the sites are located where water comes out of the ground
and
begins to flow away downhill. Less frequently, sites are located on
shoulders of hills, especially ones with southern views over water.
Such conditions can be identified on a topo map even for areas that
have never been visited. To
illustrate this, here
is a random piece of topographic map, from west of here, with likely
places for rock piles circled. In the red circles, associated with
water coming out of the ground, smaller rock piles
built on support rocks are expected. In the blue circles, associated
with southern views over water, larger
piles built directly on the ground are expected.
</p>

<p>
This is a part of Leominster State Forest, where I had never been.
</p>
<p>
To test this statement, and it being a nice day, I went out and
explored in this area above the "C" in "Princeton" on the map. In the
snow,
fewer things are visible and it is hard to cover much distance but I
found at least two larger ground piles looking out southwest over
Paradise Pond (the lake under "I" in "Princeton"). These fit the
expectations of
the blue circles. I also found a pair of piles near a
run-off gully, built on support rocks. These fit the expectations of
the red circles. Here are example pictures from Leominster State
Forest.
</p>

<p>
The first picture is a typical "blue circle" pile and location. It
shows
a marker pile with one central "marker" stone above a southwestern view
over a pond. The pile is on the ground, reasonably large, and
rectangular. The second picture is
a typical "red circle" pile and location. It shows a small pile with a
handful of cobbles on a support boulder. A few feet to the southeast is
a dip in the ground which provides a channel for run-off water. I did
not get to the exact
locations I had made predictions for but applying the principles did
lead to finding rock piles nearby. We might issue a challenge to
field clearing
proponents: to find a rock pile site in the snow, a half an hour drive
away in an unfamiliar town - in less than an hour.
</p>

<h4>Rock piles are probably not just from field clearing.</h4>
<p>
One of the most interesting observation about the site distribution
is that rock pile sites are
concentrated in rocky upland locations which were orchards, pastures,
or swamp-land. In particular, <b>where
field clearing never occurred.</b> We conclude that not only are
rock piles not just the result of field
clearing, in some cases they were probably even destroyed by
agriculture.
The actual site distribution is so much the opposite of what would
be expected based on the field clearing theory, it is hard to believe
its proponents
(1) ever came in contact with more than one or two actual sites or, if
they did, that they have reported them accurately.
</p>
<p>
Examples from Concord are instructive. Concord, with its
fertile soil, probably had the most farming of any of these towns; yet
it has far
fewer rock piles than the less agricultural towns to
the north like Carlisle and Acton. The largest rock pile site in
Concord, on Annursnac Hill, occurs several hundred feet uphill
from lowlands which might have been plowed. Another significant
cluster of rock piles in Concord occurs along a ridge uphill from
Willow Guzzle
Brook. Why would anyone carry rocks uphill to dispose of them? A third
site
in Concord, is located twenty yards into a swamp near one edge of
Estabrook Woods. A field could have been located nearby but why put
piles
in the interior of the swamp rather than at its edge? There is no need
to look hard for answers. The field
clearing hypothesis is simply not consistent with most of these sites.
</p>
<p>
To be fair, a number of fields were cleared into rock piles. This is
seen at Great Brook Farm in Carlisle and at Weatherbee Conservation
Land in
Acton. At these places there are rock piles near the edges of fields.
Ironically, these sites have well defined characteristics which make
them easy to distinguish - with poorly made piles made of poorly sorted
glacial till all scattered around the edges of the plow-able land.
Before anyone ventures
opinions about the nature of rock piles in general, they should
acquaint themselves first-hand with known field clearing examples. How
they
differ from the sites in the uplands of Acton, Carlisle, Boxborough,
etc will then be more obvious.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned earlier, rock piles are most frequently found where hill
meets water. For example, a spring on a hillside is a very likely
location of a rock pile site; or a place where a hill descends into a
swamp. By their nature, such places are poor areas for farming. Rocky
hillsides and swamps were not plowed and often rock piles are found far
from any field which might have been cleared. This evidence is
perfectly straightforward. That it is not understood
by authorities in Massachusetts responsible for protecting sites is a
scandal.
</p>

<h4>Opportunities for further study</h4>
<p>
Once these sites are recognized as having a great deal of particular
structure, highly organized and consistent with landforms
where they occur, then it begins to seem likely they are Native
American and similar to mound sites found throughout the east and the
southeast (2). That this window into the ceremonial life of natives in
Massachusetts would still be available, in spite of farming and other
efforts to erase its presence, is good news for anyone interested in a
deeper understanding of the Indians of this region.

project area is part of a larger parcel that was the subject of an
archeological assessment conducted by Alan Leveille of PAL in 2002.
Upon review of Mr. Leveille's report, a copy of which was included with
the PNF, MHC concurs with his conclusions that the stone piles found in
the Benfield property are most likely the result of agricultural land
use dating from the eighteenth through early twentieth centuries."</i>
