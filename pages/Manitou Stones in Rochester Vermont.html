<h2 style="text-align:center">Manitou Stones in Rochester Vermont</h2>
<h4 style="text-align:center">by Norman Muller</h4>

<p>
I had seen what is often termed Manitou stones at a site in Rochester,
 Vermont, in the years preceding 2007, three examples to be exact. But I felt
there should be more, and so in early November of 2007, while on my way to
Burlington, VT, to give a talk at the annual meeting of the Eastern States
Archaeological Federation, I made a stop at the site designated R7-1 to look
more carefully for Manitou stones. There are more there than I expected, as
the following examples attest. I have not given the site a systematic
going-over, and undoubtedly more are to be found.
</p>

<p>
Manitou stones are often thin, triangular or round profiled
stones set on edge against or in front of large cairns or mounds, and what I
term platform cairns. Some of these stones may be in the shape of a colonial
period gravestone, with a head-and-shoulders shape, similar to a small one that
Bob Miner discovered in Rhode Island propping up one end of a stone slab (Fig.
1).
</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>
These stones seem to be commemorative in some way,
emphasizing the importance of the stone mound or cairn against which they have
been placed. For example, the small Manitou stone shown in Figure 1 is not
much more than a foot high and may reference the space underneath the stone
slab rather than the slab itself.
</p>

<p>
At the Rochester site, the first Manitou stone that one
usually comes upon first is found in front of a large, but mostly ruinous stone
cairn near a dirt road that was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps
in the 1930s. The cairn is about twenty feet long and no more than thirty feet
from the road (Fig. 2).It is difficult to see the Manitou stone in this
image as it blends in with the shapes and colors of the stones in back. This
is one of the few ruined cairns at the site, and since there are colonial farm
foundations just to the east of the cairn, a few hundred feet away, and in back
of where I was standing when I took the photo, I have concluded that many of
the stones from the cairn were used to construct the barn and house foundations
and perhaps walls in the vicinity.

<p>
A side view of this Manitou stone, taken during this
November trip, shows the stone in better detail at the far left of the image
(Fig. 3).One can generally make out the round arched shape of the stone.
This is the usual shape of Manitou stones at the site.

  </div>
</div>

<p>
From this location, I wandered through the woods to the
southwest, passing through a rather swampy area until I came upon a low stone
mound next to a flowing brook (Fig. 4).
</p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-around">

  </div>
</div>

<p>
Here the Manitou stone, light gray in color, nicely
contrasts with the darker stones of the low stone mound to the left of the
brook. Invisible in this photograph, and at the other end of this mound, was
another Manitou stone (Fig. 5), which was shaped much like the first one and
apparently of the same kind of metamorphic stone. This is the only such stone
mound with two Manitou stones, and this additional accent must emphasize the
importance of this particular mound.
</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>
This stone mound, as seen from the north end, is quite well
finished and has an oval shape (Fig. 6).The Manitou stone shown in Fig. 5 is
in profile to the left in Fig.6.The piece of white birch log in the stream at
the bottom left of the photo can also be seen in Fig. 6 and serves as a marker
to identify the location of the Manitou stone. Note that this mound is
literally on an island between two streams.

<p>
Several years ago, I began to pay attention to Manitou
stones at the site when I saw and photographed a stone mound or cairn with a
Manitou stone positioned at one end (Fig. 7).This was a rather nondescript
mound halfway down the slope from the higher or western edge to the bottom to
the east. From this point on I began to look carefully for these stones.
</p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-around">
  <div style="margin: 10px; text-align:center">

    <div>Fig 7</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
The next one I saw was the one at the end of the spectacular
crescent cairn at the western border of the site (Fig. 8).I have already
discussed this cairn in a previous article ('An Unusual Crescent-Shaped Cairn
and the Significance of Quartz' <a href="/pages/Smith_Farm.html">Smith Farm</a>).
An end view of this cairn is shown in Fig. 3 of the article.
</p>

<p>
This cairn, I conclude, is the most important and
significant at the site, not only because of its marvelously constructed shape
and its location at the western or upper border of the site, but also because
of the presence of quartz that was carefully placed in the very front center of
the cairn.

  </div>
</div>

<p>
Continuing to wander through the site last November, I came
across another Manitou stone, this one against a cairn not far from the first one
I came across that day (Fig. 9).
</p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-around">
  <div style="margin: 10px; text-align:center">

  </div>
</div>

<p>
Near the foundation stones at the site are a number of
impressive cairns that the owners of the farm never bothered to remove in the
mid-1800s. Why should they when they were carefully constructed in the first
place and generally built on ledge outcrops or boulders, such as this example
(Fig. 10).To attempt to remove them would have been wasted energy, when they
had more important tasks at hand.
</p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-around">
  <div style="margin: 10px; text-align:center">
    <img src="Manitou%20Stones%20in%20Rochester%20Vermont_files/image010.jpg" width="384" height="255">
    <div>Fig 10</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
Nearby was a wonderful stone construction on a large boulder
or ledge outcrop. Some hemlock branches obscured one side of the construction,
and so I removed them to reveal a very unusual shaped slab of stone leaning
against the carefully piles stones (Fig. 11).This slab looked like the
profile of a mountain.
</p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-around">
  <div style="margin: 10px; text-align:center">
    <img src="Manitou%20Stones%20in%20Rochester%20Vermont_files/image011.jpg" width="384" height="255">
    <div>Fig 11</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
A detail photo of the stone shows its shape better (Fig.
12):
</p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-around">

    <div>Fig 12</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
This stone mound, like so many others at the site, had no
real shape, but seemed simply to conform to the underlying shape of the bedrock
and continued beyond the rock outcrop to form a spill of stone around the east
facing side (Fig. 13.
</p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-around">
  <div style="margin: 10px; text-align:center">
    <img src="Manitou%20Stones%20in%20Rochester%20Vermont_files/image013.jpg" width="384" height="255">
    <div>Fig 13</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
This construction (what else to call it?) went on for about
thirty feet or so, and represented an incredible amount of work. Whoever built
this first had to find the stones and then carry them to the site where the
mound is located. I seriously doubt they were found just where the stone mound
is located, since the area around it is now largely free of stones, and if one
walks beyond the probable borders of the farm into heavily forested areas that
were obviously never farmed, there is no appreciable increase in the amount of
stones found on the ground. So the question that I have been asking myself
every time I visit the site is where did all the stones come from?The slope
above the farm was not cultivated to any extent, and it was probably used as a
hay source, since two or three rusty scythe blades were found there two to
three years ago. Stones will not be worked to the surface from land that hasn't
been cultivated.
</p>

<p>
The mystery of these 150+ cairns or stone mounds persists,
but we are working to remove the veil of secrecy that presently surrounds this
site.
