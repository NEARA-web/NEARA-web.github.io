<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
Within a mile and a half of the <a href="/pages/Smith_Farm.html">Smith cairn site</a> off West Hill Road,
which is the largest cairn site in the area with more than 150 manmade
stone constructions of various shapes and sizes, are three other cairn
sites, each designated with a letter and a numeral.  The Smith
site is often referred to as R7-1.  Site R7-2, for instance, which
is the subject of this report, is approximately1.3 miles south of the
Smith site.  R7-6 is on the other side of Jones Mountain off Bingo
Road, one mile away; and R7-8, next to a beaver pond, is .7 miles
northeast of the Smith site.  None of these is as large as the
Smith site in terms of the number and variety of the stonework or even
the size of the area, but each is distinctive and important in its own
right, and all display the same fastidious stonework that one finds at
the Smith site.  This quality of workmanship, which if one thinks
about it, raises the awkward question of who built all these
structures, and when.  A few years ago, some half-dozen
archaeologists met at the Smith site one spring day, and because they
saw only this one site, they were under the mistaken impression that
one of the farmers who owned the property was responsible for all the
stonework.  Little did they know that similar well-built cairns
were not only within a mile or two of this one, but also at dispersed
sites in Vermont and elsewhere (see<a href="/pages/Stockbridge Cairn Site.html">
Stockbridge Cairn Site</a>), implying that the construction
of these mysterious structures was part of a widespread cultural
activity not related to colonial farming.

<h3>Site R7-2</h3>

<p>
Site R7-2 is perhaps the most enticing, perplexing and fascinating of
all the sites mentioned above.  Located off West Hill Road, it is
roughly square in area, approximately 10.3 acres in size, and bordered
by two streams running north-south, each about 200 m (670 ft.) apart,
and by two walls running east-west, as shown in Figure 1, again the
approximate distance apart.  All the stone features are contained
within these borders.  Five years ago, Ernie Clifford, a
perceptive Vermont native and intrepid investigator of Vermont
stonework, showed me this and other cairn sites in the Rochester
area.  He, more than anyone, is responsible for bringing these
important sites to my and other's attention, and he has conducted
important research into this particular site.

<h3>Wall-over-the-Stream</h3>

By far, the wall-over-the-stream at point A on Figure 1 is the
most intriguing and impressive of all the features at the site. 
At its southern end it is an awesome sight, being an imposing 2 m (7
ft.) and 1.8 m (6 ft.) wide (Fig. 2), gradually tapering to a still
tall but more modest .9 m (3 ft) to 1.5 meters (5 ft.) for the next 30
meters (100 ft.).  Some of the stones comprising the bottom end of
the wall are massive, such as a 1.2 m (4 ft.) long horizontal slab of
stone, which based on size alone, must weigh more than 450 kg. (1000
lbs).  From here, the wall extends over 120 m (400 ft.) uphill to
within about 6 m (20 ft.) south of the wall trace at its northern
border.  The wall does not cross or parallel the stream but is
constructed directly on top of it, meaning that it follows all the
perambulations of the stream as it meanders down the slope from the
north.  One can sense the curvature of the wall near the very
bottom, by standing on top and looking south to where the wall begins
(Fig. 3).  The nearly 46 m (150 ft.) long southern portion of the
wall is the best preserved, and for the next 27 m (90 ft. or so uphill
the wall deteriorates to a jumble of massive loose stones with five
separate breaks or breeches in it.

In October 2002, Ernie paced off the wall from its northern end,
recording each of the five wall breaks and other distinctive features
as he encountered them down to the bottom, or the wall's
beginning.  Years earlier he had noticed that there were large
capstones at the various breaks in the wall, and that there appeared to
be a culvert underneath these stones.  He then noted that this
culvert seemed to begin at least 7.6 m (25 ft.) in front of the bottom
part of the wall, just to the right of the base of the large tree in
the bottom center of Figure 4.  Figure 5 is a detail of the
opening, which shows the piled support stones on the left, and some
support stones on the right which are somewhat out of place; above is
the capstone.

The wall was intentionally breeched at four locations, undoubtedly to
allow the farmer who owned property west of the wall to have access to
his orchard on the east side of it.  The stones that were part of
the wall at these points were probably used to construct the
foundations of the barn and house plus the walls that are found in the
vicinity of the farmhouse.  At the four breeched spots large flat
capstones are exposed.  Ernie found that for most of the
capstones, their widths average about 1 meter (3 feet), while the
lengths vary from 1.5 m (5 ft.) to 2.4 m (8 ft.), their long axis being
perpendicular to the channel that they cover.  Having wandered extensively through the area, I have seen rounded and
some smallish flat pieces of gneiss and other types of rock, but not
large flat slabs.  I've often wondered where all these
capstones came from.  There must be more than a hundred of them
along the length of this wall, and not having seen any stones this size
or shape in the area covered by R7-2, I am convinced that they must
have come from somewhere else and then were carried to the
wall-over-the-stream site to be used to cover the culvert.  This
must have been a major undertaking, and the labor involved must have
been extensive, undoubtedly comprising the effort of many
people. At about 250 feet from the bottom of the wall is one of the areas where
several capstones are exposed.  Ernie Clifford is shown at this
location (Fig. 6) peering with the aid of a small flashlight into one
of the cracks between the capstones.  Another view of this
location (Fig. 7) shows the opening to the culvert, behind and above
which is the rough wall sinuously curving up the slope, and Figure 8 is
a detail of the culvert opening.  In an e-mail Ernie sent to me
five years ago, he described the culvert channel at this location as
being .6 m (2 ft.) wide and .6 meters deep below the capstones. 
Where the walls could be observed, they consisted of several courses of
flat stones, the one exception being a very large stone 1.5 m (5 ft.)
long and .4 m (18 in.) high.
