<h2 style="text-align:center">Delaware Water Gap</h2>
<h4 style="text-align:center">by Norman E. Muller</h4>

<p>
Jim Wilson, a friend of mine from the Bethlehem, PA, area 
and the one who rediscovered the two walls on the side of Blue Mountain, PA,
that A.E. Berlin had described in the late 1880s as an Indian deer weir (I
highly doubt this interpretation), was bird watching near the Delaware Water
Gap Visitor's Center about three weeks ago, and came across an unusual and
impressive assemblage of stone features. He invited me to see this site,
and so latethis week I drove to the Visitor's Center at the Water Gap to
meet him. The area containing the stonework is on the other side of a bog
just to the east of the Visitor's Center, and some of the stonework is visible
from it. We got in his truck and drove to the other side of the bog, where
we parked. This area is beautiful, with maple and hemlock trees
predominating. Several rocky ridges run north-south, with narrow terraces
separating them. These terraces probably formed when the river level was
much higher at the end of the last ice age.
</p>

<p>
We walked along one of the valleys or terraces between two
ridges, the one on the left being very rocky and steep (Image 104) with large
broken slabs of shale and sandstone having tumbled to the forest floor
below.
</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The first feature we encountered was a low stone wall that
was perpendicular to the flat terrace we were walking on (Image 67). It
originated from a curious terrace fill across a narrow gully, which I first
thought might be a dam of some sort (Image 68), and cut the slope to the rocky
ridge to the west, and then ended. </p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>
We followed along the east side of the rocky ridge and soon
came upon the first non-wall construction, a carefully built fill between two
outcrops (Image 74). The stone comprising the construction (I hesitate
what to call it. It does not seem to be a cairn, as it has no particular
shape to it) was made of local shale and sandstone flat slabs, carefully
piled.
</p>

<p>
Then we began to see more constructions of this type, such
as the wall like connection along a rocky flat outcrop (Image 80).
A short while further on Jim and I came upon a curious looking chamber, formed
by the vertical wall of an outcrop and a vertical slab of stone set apart from
it. Large flat stones formed the roof (Image 84). This little
chamber then merged into a short stone wall at the base of the rocky ridge.

  </div>
</div>

<p>
We kept seeing stone accents on the rocky ridge as we
followed it north along its base, such as an impressive 'V'-shaped fill between
two boulders (Image 86) that reminded me of others I've seen at the Oley Hills
site and in S. Newfane, VT. On the opposite side of the V-fill was
another stone accent (Image 87)

  </div>
</div>

<p>
Further on we came upon a large vertical outcrop, on top of
which, to the left, was a small stone construction (Image 92), and an
overhanging slab in the middle. Other constructions drew our attention,
such as one nicely formed pile of stones (Image 96) and others on either side
of a large boulder (Image 100).

</div>

<p>
Just to the east of where we were walking was a terrace
bathed in soft light overlooking the Delaware River below (Image 106).
Along this terrace edge was a stone wall, faintly visible in the image.
When we reached the terrace, I observed a low wall that traced the edge of the
terrace for hundreds of feet both north and south (Image 114), and it reminded
me of a similar wall on Morgan Mountain in Alabama that Harry Holstein, an
archaeologist there, had told me about. We followed the wall to near
where it petered out, and then we headed down slope to another wall that
paralleled the one we were just on. Walking north along this wall, I soon
saw in the distance another wall cutting across the direction we were
headed. Where the two walls diverged was not a sharp corner, but instead
a lazy curve (Image 118).

  </div>
</div>

<p>
This other wall was much higher than the one we had been
following, and it had on top of it, every so often, large water rounded cobbles
of quartzite that contrasted color-wise with the gray of the shale and
sandstone (Images 119, 120). While this wall could be interpreted by some
as Colonial, the quartzite accents on top
</p>

<p>
imparted a unique character that separated it from any
colonial interpretation. One has to wonder where the quartzite came
from. There were no stones of this kind that I observed on the ground
nearby or on the way to this feature, and I could only conclude that the stones
must have come from the Delaware River far below, which then had been carried
to the wall site. How else?
</p>

<p>
On our way back to Jim's truck, we returned to the ridge
overlooking the Delaware River and followed another portion of the wall (Image
128) we were on just earlier. We then headed west to the bog, where Jim
showed me another unusual wall on top of a rocky spine separating a vernal pool
to our left (east) and the bog to the west (Image 132).

<p>
We followed this upslope (Image 136). Looking back
(Image 139), I could see where we had just come from.

<p>
In hindsight, I am totally convinced that major features
such as the Delaware River and other similar major river thoroughfares for the
Indians had, along its rocky banks, accents in stone, whether they be cairns or
the type of constructions I had just seen, or walls that traced ridges or
unusual landscape features. A year ago, I had seen unusual looking stone
piles along the slopes of the Delaware River banks on the NJ side north of Port
Jervis, and this whetted my appetite for seeing more. Most of my own
research has focused on northern New England, but I am convinced that I and
others can find important stone constructions much closer to home. The
Northeast is full of such features waiting to be discovered. Now, if we
could only convince archaeologists to open their eyes to what's around
them!
