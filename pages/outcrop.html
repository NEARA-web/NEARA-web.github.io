<h2 style="text-align:center">An Unusual Ledge Outcrop in Hopkinton, Rhode Island</h2>
<h4 style="text-align:center">by Norman Muller</h4>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
In Hopkinton, Rhode Island, in the southwestern part of the state, lies
Miner Farm, a beautiful rural working farm located in rocky
terrain. Crisscrossed with colonial walls, and bisected by a
now-abandoned colonial road, it is also home to a number of intriguing
stone features that I conclude are much older than the obvious
reminders of colonial farming practices. A history of this farm
is found in a web article by Jim Porter titled "Early History of
the Miner Farm: Preliminary Report"
(<a href="http://menotomyjournal.com/minerearlyhistoryweb.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://mentonmyjournal.com/minerearlyhistoryweb.pdf</a>),
which includes images of some unusual stone constructions not illustrated in this article.
</p>

<p>
In March 2007, Bob Miner, the present owner, showed my wife and me some
unusual, possibly manmade stone features. Toward the end of our
stay, he asked if I'd like to see a rock outcrop just south of
the ancient colonial road where he said there was some odd
stonework. I could not turn down an invitation like this, and
soon we were tramping through the open cedar and oak woods to the
outcrop. This outcrop and its associated stonework were so
intriguing that I was determined to visit it again and spend more time
studying it in greater detail. In early November 2008 I made my
return visit, and what follows is an account of what I found.
</p>

<p>
Here in the Northeast, those of us who study cairns and other unusual
stonework that we believe are American Indian continually have to
confront the prevailing attitude among mainstream archaeologists that
we are wrong in our conclusions, and all of what we see is Colonial,
constructed after the invasion of Europeans in the early seventeenth
century. According to these archaeologists, the Indians did not
learn how to build walls or anything major out of stone until the
English came and taught them how to do so. These views were
outlined in the 2007 issue of Terra Firma 5, the publication of the
Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation's
Historic Landscape Preservation Initiative. In a box at the end
of the newsletter, titled "The Last Word: Debunking the Myth of
Stone Walls, Piles and Chambers", the unnamed authors wrote that
there was no archaeological evidence to support the view that any stone
walls, cairns or chambers found in the region were Native
American. Farmers would "pile surplus rocks within pastures
for later use of sale." In other words, anything we find in
the woods has to do with colonial agricultural practices, such as field
clearing, and nothing else.
</p>

<p>
To counter this, and in the absence of diagnostic artifacts that might
help establish the age of cairns and other structures, I and a few
other researchers have resorted to a number of different approaches to
prove our argument. For myself, this includes in many instances a
deed search, scouring the historical literature for information about
the site or features being investigated, walking through the site and
observing the landscape and local geology, seeing how various features
relate to the landscape and to each other, photography, plus wide
reading of ethnographic, anthropological, and archaeological literature
that sheds light on Indian beliefs and practices as they might relate
to the cultural landscape. In one way or another, all of these
are brought to bear on the topic at hand, and hopefully it is a
combination of these that will prove the case I am trying to
make. This approach was recently outlined in an article of mine
titled <a href="/pdf/oleyhill.pdf">Accenting the Landscape: Interpreting the Oley Hills
Site</a> (Muller 2008) and one by Herman Bender
("Seeking Place: Living On and Learning from the Cultural Landscape") in
the same publication (Bender 2008). 
</p>

<p>
Let us now examine the outcrop.

<h3>The Outcrop</h3>

<p>
We approach the outcrop from the northeast. From a slight
distance the heavily fissured outcrop rises, dome-like, from a low
knoll. It is 1.5m high above the surrounding terrain on the north
side, increasing to 2.5m on the sloping downhill south side. It
is also roughly 8m in diameter (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 1</span>). The woods are
fairly open, with pines, cedars and oaks predominating. Other
large glacially worn boulders lay scattered around it. When I
first laid eyes on this outcrop more than a year ago, I thought of what
Joan and Romas Vastokas wrote about the Peterborough petroglyph site in
Ontario: "Boulders, rocky hills, and outcropping with unusual
dimensions or character, such as clefts, holes, or crevices, were
especially charged with Manitou and often conceived as the
dwelling-places of mythological creatures" (Vastokas &amp;
Vastokas 1973, 48).This seemed a perfect example of what I was
seeing, and further investigation would bear this out.
</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>
As one approaches the outcrop, one immediately notices that the sloped
north-facing side is covered with small fist-sized rocks, heavily
patinated with lichen (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 2</span>) and partially covered with moss and
soil. There must be hundreds of rounded, fist-size and slightly
larger stones randomly distributed over the surface. While some
might conclude that farmers could have tossed loose rocks on the
surface as field clearing, the heavy lichen patination of the rocks
with the moss suggested great age. It was at this point that I
entertained the idea that the stones were donations. There are
many accounts in the colonial literature of educated individuals like
Ezra Stiles observing Indians tossing stones on stone piles as they
passed by, the piles often being memorials to dead warriors.
Timothy Dwight, on a trip he took through New England in 1798,
described a large stone burial mound on Monument Mountain north of
Great Barrington, where every Indian who passed by threw a stone on the
mound (Dwight 1821-22, II, 380-381).The stones on the outcrop in
Hopkinton could be viewed in the same way: as a donation or gift to the
sacredness of the spot and the spirits that resided within.
</p>

<p>
Walking around the outcrop in a counterclockwise direction, the first
thing one encounters is a large vertical fissure filled with stones
(<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 3</span>).This fissure is probably an extension of the larger one
visible on the other side of the outcrop in Fig. 1.The stone
cobbles do not appear to have accidentally fallen into the crack by
those who deposited stones on top, but instead were deliberately wedged
in place. 
</p>

<p>
This type of feature, which I and other researchers refer to as a
split-filled boulder, is simply a larger and more elaborate version of
the single split-wedged boulder, an example
of which is found only 9m northeast of the outcrop (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 4</span>).Both
examples are common in southern New England and especially Rhode
Island, where Larry Harrop, an investigator of rock feature sites, had
recorded 81 examples of the former feature, and 39 of the latter
(<a href="http://rockpiles.ws/main.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://rockpiles.ws/main.php</a>).Next to cairns and stone piles,
these are the most common stone feature to be found in the
region. While one might think that this is just a local
phenomenon, it is actually found across North America. Examples
are known from Georgia and Minnesota, but it is in California where it
has received the greatest scholarly attention.

<p>
David Whitley's 1999 article on Sally's Rockshelter helped
place split-wedged and split-filled boulders in proper
perspective. In investigating this large shelter complex in the
Mohave Desert of central California, Whitley found fissures jammed with
six unworked quartz cobbles (Whitley 1999, 226 and Fig. 5).
Considerable ethnographic research by Whitley and others has uncovered
evidence that rocks were considered numinous by American Indians, with
the spiritual world thought to reside in these rocks.
Furthermore, "cracks in the rock were conceived to be portals
into the sacred realm" (Whitley 1999, 234).The quartz
stones found in the cracks at Sally's Rockshelter were thought to
be offerings to the spirits residing in the stone, which could freely
pass in and out through the cracks. Based on the pecked
petroglyphs that were found underneath the overhang of the rockshelter,
which suggested the visions of someone in a trance, Whitley concluded
that the quartz cobbles had been placed there by a shaman on a vision
quest. Quartz was not found in the immediate area of the shelter,
and thus must have been deliberately brought to the site from
elsewhere.  
</p>

<p>
Throughout the New England area, we find boulders, outcrops and ledges
with large splits filled with one or more stone cobbles. There is
a spectacular example in Fahnestock State Park in New York, where a
large vertical outcrop with phenomenal attributes has a long, 2m long
vertical fissure filled with stones (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 5</span>; see also<a href="/pages/Fahnestock Memorial State Park.html"> Muller 2007</a>).
A large, wider example is also found in South Newfane,
Vermont, which also has some interesting stone accents to either side
of it (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 6</span>; see also<a href="/pages/Fahnestock Memorial State Park.html"> Muller 2007</a>, fig. 14).
All of these examples, I conclude, are versions of the same expression as single
stones wedged in cracks or fissures.
</p>

  <div style="margin: 10px; text-align:center">
    <img style="width: 450px; height: 299px;" alt="" src="outcrop_files/Fig.%206.jpg">
  </div>
</div>

<p>
Similar views about how Indians viewed rocks and fissures were
expressed by the Vastokases in their book about the Peterborough
petroglyphs (Vastokas &amp; Vastokas, 46,49).This again
demonstrates that the Indians viewed the entire landscape as animated
and charged with meaning. We must recognize, however, that this
is a view and response not restricted solely to North America, but is
instead world wide, and extends millennia back in time.
</p>

<p>
Whereas spirits may enter and leave cracks in rock, there is also a
female connotation to them, based on the fact that the earth is
considered feminine in that it gives birth and sustenance to all sorts
of life forms. This was made visually apparent at the
Peterborough petroglyph site in Ontario, Canada, where an open area of
large limestone slabs has been elaborately pecked with dozens of
petroglyphs. Numerous cavities carved out by water punctuate the
limestone, and underneath water can be heard running. As the
Vastokases have written in their important and fascinating book on this
remarkable site, it was the combination of a number of numinous factors
that made this such an important sacred site for the Algonkian
Indians. Serpents have been carved leaving and entering the
cracks (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 7</span>:the serpents are shown in the center of the image
with the black void of the limestone in the middle), and two of these
cavities have been transformed into vulvas (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 8</span>) (Vastokas &amp;
Vastokas, 50-52; 80).

<p>
While the rock art sites in California have a shamanistic
interpretation because of the petroglyphs found there, no petroglyphs
have been found at the outcrop site in Hopkinton, RI, nor at any of the
other sites I have examined. It is possible that the stone
accents at the outcrop are the work of shamans, but it is also possible
that such actions were done by Indian passers-by in a ritualistic and
spiritual frame of mind over centuries and even millennia as they
encountered the unusual outcrop and responded to its numinous
character. As Jack Steinbring would say, the outcrop has
phenomenal characteristics, given its location, shape, the deep
fissures cutting across it, plus the attention it has been given by
placing small rocks on and in it (Steinbring 1992, 102, 107).
This is further emphasized as one continues around the outcrop to the
south end, where large sections of stone have broken off in the distant
past from frost action, leaving a weathered, angular surface (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig.
9</span>). 
</p>

<p>
Most interesting, when observed in the oblique
light of late spring afternoon a year ago, is a curious rock protrusion
in the lower right portion of the outcrop, the remainder of the rock
that broke off around it. Indians were aware of how light and
shadow can create unusual shapes, turning an unspectacular rock
formation seen in the flat light of an overcast day, into an animal or
even a monster. To me, and in the right oblique light, the
protrusion looks like a turtle head. Devereux (2000) would refer
to this as a simulacrum, with the dome-like outcrop rising above like a
carapace. The turtle was especially sacred to the Algonkians,
symbolic of the earth and of fertility (Vastokas &amp; Vastokas, 107),
and in this particular location it makes sense, given the overall shape
of the outcrop and the fissures that punctuate it. In flat,
even light, the protrusion looks unremarkable (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 10</span>), but there is
little doubt that attention was directed to this curious natural
feature, for a small pile of stones is found at its base, and line of
stones extends outward from it to touch a nearby boulder (visible in
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 9</span>).From the lower end of this boulder a low wall begins and
then dissolves into a curved line of single stones that ends just about
in line with the protrusion, but does not touch the outcrop to complete
a circle (see<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Fig. 10</span>).Stone circles have been found adjacent to
unusual boulders in New England. The circle could define a sacred
space and draw attention to a strong spiritual source nearby, and this
incomplete example could simply be a version of this. 
</p>

<p>
The outcrop, the only one in the area, reveals its secrets only with
careful study and an open mind. Most would probably walk past it
and not know that they were seeing a visible reminder of an important
cultural response, hundreds or even thousands of years old, to the rock
landscape. Amazingly, southern New England and especially Rhode
Island, is littered with examples of the Indian's response to the
landscape. Larry Harrop and Peter Waksman
(<a href="https://rockpiles.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rockpiles.blogspot.com</a>) have photographically recorded
thousands of examples of native stonework over the past ten years which
they have posted on their blogs and websites, and we can only hope that
those who are entrusted with saving our past will eventually recognize
the lithic riches that are within one's grasp.
