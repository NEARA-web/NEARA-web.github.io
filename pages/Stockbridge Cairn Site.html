<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
For the past ten years, I have spent
a considerable amount of my free time exploring various cairn sites
from Pennsylvania to New England and beyond, attempting to discover a
pattern of design that might help to explain who constructed the
cairns, and when.  With many sites up for grabs as our society
expands and wild lands become more threatened, the cairns and other
stone constructions found on these lands are also at risk. 
Much has undoubtedly already been lost to development.
</p>

<p>
In 1997, when I began my study of the Oley Hills site in Berks County,
Pennsylvania, I wanted to determine who constructed the impressive and
unusual cairns, platforms, walls and terrace, and possibly their
date.  The previous owner had concluded that the stone
features were Celtic, and archaeologists were pretty dismissive of anything
constructed of stone, concluding the features were Colonial. 
I had many archaeologists visit the site, but relatively few were
interested enough in it to help to understand it or even comment on
it.  In spite of this disinterest on the part of
archaeologists, I continued to search for evidence, and in time came up with some
information that in the future may help to save this site and others
like it.

<p>
The following spring I had Bill Sevon, a geomorphologist with the Pennsylvania Geological Survey, visit the site with his wife.
As we walked through it, I pointed out the various stone features.
At the large boulder (Fig. <b>A</b>), which I concluded was the heart of the site,
he remarked that the boulder was not a glacial erratic but a tor, which in this case was the 
highly weathered remains of a bedrock outcrop that had eventually eroded
loose from the ledge it now sits on (Muller 1998, 1999).
The last continental glacier, the Wisconsin, ended its southern movement twenty miles
north of the Oley Hills site, which precluded any glacial erratics
being found south of this margin.
At one time, Bill said, the boulder probably rocked, and that the small stacks of rock
under the north end of it were placed to keep it from rocking (Fig. <b>B</b>).
Eventually large sections of the south end of the boulder broke loose and now form a semicircle of stone slabs
underneath it.When that happened, the boulder lost its rocking abilities.
</p>

    <div>Fig D</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
We then walked to the large inclined cairn (Fig. <b>C</b>), and there Bill pointed to four large
quartz cobbles imbedded in the east face of the cairn (Fig. <b>D</b>.
The quartz appears as light gray on the image ) and said that the quartz could not have come from
the ridge where the cairn is located, since the ridge was composed entirely of a granitic
gneiss with only a dike of diabase intruding into it.
Furthermore, since the glacier stopped twenty miles to the north, any
anomalous rock could not be attributed to glacial debris. Consequently, the
quartz had to have come from a presently unknown location in the valley below where pegmatites
are more common. This of course meant that the
quartz was deliberately sought out and brought to the cairn site to be
placed in the east facing side.Examining this
process more closely, it is highly unlikely that that an eighteenth
century German immigrant farmer would have done this.
Yet because of the association of quartz in a ritualistic
sense with the American Indian, the placement of quartz makes for a more logical
interpretation of the cultural origin of this one monumental cairn and
of others at the site.
</p>

<p>
Since then, I have sought answers from other sites to help understand and explain who
constructed the manmade stone features found on them.
In many instances, the information remains elusive, but
for the Smith cairn site in Rochester, Vermont, the detailed deed information that we
have for it, combined with a collection of ledgers or daybooks that were
kept by Chester Smith, the farmer who worked the land from 1847 to his death in
1903, help to remove his name and other former landowners from the roster of
those who might have been responsible for constructing the cairns, since
there was no evidence in the daybooks that Smith built the cairns, nor is it likely
that the former landowners did either.
Some of this data I have laid out in the web article <a href="/pages/Smith_Farm.html">An Unusual
Crescent-Shaped Cairn and the Significance of Quartz</a>, (Muller 2007b).I
believe that the repetition of certain stone features or accents from site to site throughout the
Northeast is an indication of a region-wide cultural response to the landscape,
and is highly unlikely to be interpreted or placed at the doorstep of colonial
farmers if examined carefully and with an open mind.
In fact, there is no written or documentary evidence that
farmers constructed such large cairns
as those found on sites in Vermont to enhance farm production; building them was
exceedingly time consuming
and makes absolutely no sense when farmers had trouble enough just
trying to survive on upland farm sites.With
regard to stone accents, I am thinking particularly of split-wedged
boulders and the deliberate placement of quartz in striking locations in cairns.If
we examine these accents from a regional perspective, they take on
heightened significance.
</p>

<p>
By pointing out how similar features are found at sites many miles distant from one
another, we then begin to weave a story that will help to undermine the paradigm still
held by archaeologists in the Northeast that the Indians had no stone building
technology until this part of North America was settled by Europeans in
the seventeenth century. Many out there, such as Peter Waksman,
Larry Harrop and others, have assembled
data, photographic and otherwise, that will help to form a new
prehistory of the region.
</p>

<p>
The study below of a site in Stockbridge, Vermont, should be viewed as just one more piece of the
puzzle. I have noted where necessary how certain
distinctive features have been found elsewhere at sites from Pennsylvania to southern Vermont, thus emphasizing the regional nature of
this phenomenon. Besides being fascinating in their own right, they also make for a compelling story.
</p>

<h3>Stockbridge Site</h3>

<p>
Of the half dozen or so major cairn
sites in Vermont, the one in Stockbridge, near the border with Barnard, is among
the most intriguing, probably because it is one of the least known and explored,
and seems to hold considerable potential.
</p>

<p>
Located on the side of a mountain off
Perkin's Brook, about a mile hike in on a logging road, it was first explored
by Ernie Clifford, a Vermont native, about ten years ago, who had heard about
it from a hunter friend. Ernie then
showed it to me one beautiful April morning four years ago, at which time I
took some photographs of two of the largest cairns
but didn't spend much time exploring the area.
2003 was the year when I was first introduced to the major cairn sites
in Vermont by Ernie, and I was
simply doing a lot of looking, and documenting as many sites photographically
as I could. But as I began to be more
familiar with certain types of cairns
and paid greater attention to how they were constructed and located in the
landscape, I thought back on the Stockbridge site and how little I really knew
about it. Upon reflection, it seemed to
be very important with respect to the other sites I had seen, particularly how
certain cairns seemed
morphologically similar to others I had seen elsewhere, and I was determined to
have a much closer look at it and probe the woods around the site.
</p>

<p>
On September 21, 2007, Ernie agreed to guide a small group of
four to the site. We met at a parking
spot at the beginning of the logging road, and then walked up a steep slope by
switchbacks to a nearly level area that had been recently logged.
 Here the road split: the more recently used
road veered to the right and eventually past a foundation and underground
chamber of an old abandoned colonial farm.
Instead we went straight ahead on an abandoned spur that was slowly
being swallowed up by trees and shrubs on either side.
 After about ten or fifteen minutes of easy
walking we were supposedly in the area of the cairns,
at an elevation of 1600 feet. Four years
ago, one beautiful April day, I visited this site when the trees and bushes had
not yet blossomed, and I could make out some of the stone cairns
from the road. But now, in late summer,
the dense foliage obscured everything beyond a few feet.
 Ernie, however, knew just where to enter the
woods, and after some easy bushwhacking we were at the first large structure in
a pine grove.
</p>

<p>
Approaching it from the south, the cairn didn't look like much. Young
saplings had fallen against the south end of it, which sloped gradually to the
ground, and some stones had been knocked out of place by repeated tree
falls. As we walked counterclockwise to the
north facing side, the construction was less disturbed and impressive looking
(Fig. 1). Here I was impressed by the
intentional directionality of the well constructed face of the cairn as opposed
to the other side. I had seen this
before at Parker Woodland in Coventry, Rhode
  Island, where five different cairns
had their well constructed side facing east.
The Stockbridge example faced north, and I am at a loss to explain this,
as I am the large cairn with the quartz cobble (see below), which also is north
facing.
</p>

<p>
The cairn was roughly rectangular
in shape with its axis oriented east-west.
It measured 10.7m long, 2.3m wide and 1.4m high (35' x 7.5' x 4.5').
 Some balsams and hemlocks perhaps thirty to
forty years old had fallen against it, criss-cross fashion (Fig. 2).
 This was not a benign looking
environment. The ground was uneven and
characteristic of 'pillow and cradle' topography that Wessels (1997) describes
as being caused by periodic tree blow-downs over a long period of time; there
was no evidence that this area had ever been cultivated, although by the size
of the trees in the area, tree harvesting had definitely occurred only decades before.

  </div>
</div>

<p>
The stones comprising the cairn appeared
to be local schist that cleaved in broad horizontal planes that permitted easy
stacking. Considerable lichen and moss
growth had formed on the surface of some exposed stones on top, which compared
quite favorably with the thick mats of moss that a group of us had seen on five
cairns near the summit of Glastenbury
  Mountain in southern Vermont
(Fig. 3), which we concluded predated the construction of the fire tower and
Long Trail to the summit between 1913 and 1930.
On the east side of the cairn was a short extension or 'tail' with a
diagnostic cobble of quartzite on top (Fig. 4) that reminded me of similar
stone extensions to some cairns at the
Smith cairn site in Rochester, Vermont.
 There, some of the extensions seemed to reach
out to connect with springs that flowed in wet seasons (Fig. 5), but here there
was no apparent water source.

<p>
I have no idea why this large cairn
and the others were built. To me, they
are monuments of some kind, although this is only a hunch and is not based on
any factual evidence. It is obvious, though, that considerable effort went into
gathering and then piling the stones, which may have required a team of
workmen, especially to move especially large stones that must weigh hundreds of
pounds, especially the one to the far left in Figure 1.
 But where did the stones come from?
 There are no concentrations of loose stone on
the ground in the area, and the terrain in the vicinity of the cairns does not
look as though it was ever tilled, which was the main means of forcing stones
to the surface through frost action.
Without tilling, stones will stay put in the ground.
 So the source of the stones remains a
mystery.
</p>

<p>
A bit further to the north, and in
a depression near the cart path, nearly out of sight, was an impressive,
slightly wedge-shaped cairn as seen from the side (Fig. 6), which as one went
around to the right, presented a tightly constructed fa'ade (Fig. 7).
 I vaguely remembered this cairn from my first
trip to the Stockbridge site, but now I was able to measure and record it
photographically. It was 2m wide by 1.5m
high (6.5' x 5').
</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>
From there we walked north along
the cart path to the bottom of a pine knoll, at the base of which was a
terrace-like construction of stones measuring 2.6m long by l.5m high by .8m
high (8.5' x 5' x 2.6') built against the slope (Fig. 8).
 Above this construction, and on top of the
knoll, was a large cairn (Fig. 9). The
combination of the small terrace construction and the large cairn reminded me
of similar arrangements I had seen at the Smith site in Rochester,
such as this small cairn at the base of a knoll, above which was a terrace wall
surrounding a low stone mound (Fig. 10).
This arrangement and juxtaposition further emphasized the directional
orientation of the features and how one should approach them: both examples
were much more impressive if seen and approached from below.
</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>
The large cairn on top of the knoll
measured 5m wide by 6.3m long by 1.9m high (16.4' x 10.6' x 6.2') and was
distinguished by having a large, round quartz cobble placed directly in the
middle of the north face (Fig. 11). This
was no accident, and the use of quartz here and in other features on the site
implies a cultural significance quite apart from any Colonial or European
association (Muller 2007b). At the
southwest corner of the cairn was an extension or 'tail,' about six feet long,
that ended at a large horizontal stone slab (Fig. 12).

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-around">
  <div style="margin: 10px; text-align:center">

    <div>Fig. 12</div>
  </div>
</div>

 Both
of these distinguishing characteristics are also found in a large cairn in
South Newfane, Vermont, where a large quartz cobble had been placed in the
north face of the cairn (Fig. 13), and at the southwest end was a wall-like
extension about eight feet long (Fig. 14).

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-around">

  </div>
</div>

Similarly, more than 200 miles to the south, at the Oley Hills site, is
Platform B (Fig. 15), a large stone platform with a terrace-like extension at
the north end that ended at some large boulders, from above looking like the
curved tail of a scorpion (Fig. 16). The
similar morphology among these three examples is more than a coincidence, I
believe, and reflects a widespread cultural and architectural response to the
landscape. 
</p>

<p>
We had seen most of the major
features at the site, but I felt we were just scratching the surface.
 Several of the others wanted to see the
chamber about a quarter mile away, but I wanted to explore more around the
large cairn. Before we split, a few of
us walked down the slope to the west from the large quartz accented cairn,
where we encountered a handful of other manmade features.
 One of them was a low rectangular construction
with several quartz pieces on top (Fig. 17).
And further to the south on the same slope was an impressive horizontal
cairn on the edge of a rock outcrop (Fig. 18).

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-around">
  <div style="margin: 10px; text-align:center">

  </div>
</div>

This reminded me of two similar constructions I had seen before:
 one at the Smith site in Rochester which
traced the edge of a curved outcrop, and was accented by a quartz cobble on top
(Fig. 19); and the other was at a site in the Delaware Water Gap in
Pennsylvania, where two careful constructions were placed on either side of a
large boulder (Fig. 20). The one in
Stockbridge did not have any quartz that I could see, but it seemed to have the
same function as the others noted above in that it simply defined and accented
the rock outcrop (Fig. 21).

<p>
Walking back to my car, I looked
for another large cairn in the woods that I had seen several years previously,
and I eventually found it obscured by a thick tangle of briers and brush in a dense
pine grove (Fig. 22). This cairn
measured 5.3m long by 2.7m wide by 1.3m high (17.3' x 8.8' x 4.2') and it had
quartz cobbles intentionally clustered in the southeast corner (Fig. 23).

<p>
Cairns were placed at a site for a
reason. In some cases, and with
patience, one can discover what attracted the cairn builders in the first
place. Often it was some natural feature
in the landscape that had phenomenal attributes, such as the limestone outcrop
at the Peterborough, Ontario,
petroglyph site, where the limestone is fissured and water can be heard flowing
underneath (Vastokas and Vastokas 1973: 49). At a site in Hackettstown,
  New Jersey, it was a beautiful waterfall
that must have attracted the builders of the six or seven large barrel-shaped cairns.
 At a large cairn site in Hallstead,
  Pennsylvania, it was a ritualized spring
(Fig. 24) enhanced with two lintels and support stones, that seemingly provided
the impetus for the construction of more than 100 large and beautifully
constructed cairns (Fig. 25).
 At the Oley Hills site in Pennsylvania
the focus was a large erratic-looking boulder (Muller 1999.
 See also Fig. A, above), and at the Smith
site in Rochester, it seems that
the prevalence of springs and the east facing slope were the main reasons why 150
plus stone cairns and other manmade
stone features were placed there (Muller 2007b).
 These are some of the most obvious examples.

<p>
But the Stockbridge site does not
easily reveal its secrets. It, like many
other sites, probably started with the construction of one cairn in response to
some distinctive natural feature or a phenomenal characteristic in the
landscape, but that has yet to be found.
Over a period of time, other stone constructions were added, so that
like the skin of an onion, these added elements obscure the original core.
 By determining the extent of the site, and by
approaching it from different directions at different times of the year, the
single feature or characteristic that stimulated all this attention might
eventually be discovered.
</p>

<h3>Addendum</h3>

<p>
In October 2010, I returned to the Stockbridge site with Dave Connelly, a friend.
I showed him the cairn with the large quartz cobble (Fig. 11, above), and from there we headed west,
down slope, to a small valley with a prominent ledge outcrop (Fig. 237).
From there, we could look behind us to a long, stacked stone cairn on a ledge outcrop (see Figs. 18 and 21, above),
probably 30 feet above where we were standing.  I had not examined this cairn closely before.

<p>
Dave decided to have a closer look at this cairn and he took off alone up the slope.
When he reached the top, he motioned to me to come up to have a look.
On top of this flat-topped cairn were three shaped and tapered recumbent standing stones,
the largest being about a meter long, and with a flat base;
the two others were slightly smaller but also had a flat base (Fig. 1406).
Apparently, they had once stood upright and were perhaps ‘killed’ when the site had lost its function.
This cairn overlooked the ledge outcrop below, which obviously had ‘phenomenal attributes’
that Jack Steinbring referred to in his 1992 article (Steinbring 1992).
