      <p>
        <b>NEARA MEMBERS PARTICIPATE</b> in the search and discovery of new sites and enjoy the challenge of better

        fields such as deed research, archaeoastronomy, and epigraphy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of these features include stone chambers, stone piles, stone walls, stone circles, propped boulders,
        petroglyphs, and stone or earthen mounds.  Many members volunteer their time and skills to the various
        research and site dating projects that are currently underway.  Members can discuss issues via our
