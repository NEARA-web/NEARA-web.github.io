  </p>
  
  <h3 id="Join">HOW TO JOIN THE NEARA FORUM</h3>
  <p>
    The forum is an opt-in group.
    If you choose to join, forum members will be able to see your name and email address.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure your NEARA membership is up to date.</li>
    <li>Agree to abide by the <a href="#CommunityGuidelines">Forum Community Guidelines</a>, listed below.</li>
    <li>Send an email to <a href="mailto:forum+managers@neara.org">forum+managers@neara.org</a>
      and ask to be added as a forum member.</li>
    <li>Once you and your email address are verified as a NEARA member, a forum moderator will add you to the forum.
      If you are a new member, it may take some time before the moderators learn about you.</li>
    <li>Forum moderators reserve the right to refuse to reinstate members who have
      previously been removed from forum membership for violating NEARA Forum Guidelines.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="Works">HOW THE NEARA FORUM WORKS</h3>
  <p>
    The forum is basically a mailing list that consists of email “threads” about specific topics.
    As a forum member, you will be able to send and receive emails from other forum members, using your email account.
  </p>
  <p>
    The forum also remembers all topics and posts so you can read them at
    <a href="https://groups.google.com" target="_blank">groups.google.com</a>
    if your email address is also a Google account.
    This allows you to read old topics, including those that were posted before you joined the group.
    If you want a Google account but want to keep your current email address, you can do that:
    <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?sjid=6677032500959627439-NA" target="_blank">Create a Google account with your non-Gmail email address</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    NEARA is an <b>antiquities research association</b>.
    Forum subject matter should be relevant to the goals and objectives of the NEARA organization.
    Discussions should be informative and promote education and research.
    Forum members should be ready to back up their assertions with facts and/or relevant research.
    Moderators may move or take down posts that do not meet NEARA's guidelines.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="Email">Sending and responding to messages</h3>
  <p>
    Use the email address you used to sign up for the forum; if you use another email address, your email will be rejected.
    Non-members cannot read or write to the forum; this helps to cut down on spam and preserves some privacy.
    Any valid email address, once a member of the forum, can receive forum posts or send messages to the forum.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only forum members logged in with their Google account can read or respond to the message threads at
