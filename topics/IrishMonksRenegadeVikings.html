  <h2>Irish Monks and Renegade Vikings</h2>

  <p>
    But it was 925 AD before Dicuil, an Irish monk records that his brethren 
    had been visiting Thule for many years. He gives a description of that 
    barren land that leaves little doubt that he is referring to Iceland. 
    Saint Brendan’s sixth century Atlantic shuttles are set down in the 
    twelfth century Navigato Sancti Brendani Abbati. Even Farley Mowat’s 
    speculation in his book the Farfarers, of the westward trail of the 
    fictitious Albans presents very plausible candidates for the white
    robed men of Vitramannaland, also known as Albana or Ireland the Great 
    which lies somewhere near Vinland.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Vikings took to the sea very 
    early and they traveled far and wide, to Miklagård, the great city of 
    Constantine, while the West Vikings, the scourge of Europe, swarmed over
    the islands of the North Atlantic and up the Seine to Paris. By 874 
    Iceland had been “discovered and the adventurous Norse ranges farther 
    west to Greenland and the illusive Vinland around 1000 AD.
  </p>
  <p>
    The North Atlantic voyager who should be considered the discoverer of the New 
    World was Gunbjorn, who fell afoul of Iceland and emerged from the fog 
    on the rocky skerries off the east coast of Greenland sometime in the 
    late ninth century. The sequel to Gunbjorn is told in both the 
    Greenlander’s saga and Erick’s saga which tell of Bjarne Herjolfsson’s 
    wind and fog-swept coasting west of his intended Greenland landfall. 
    Leif Erickson later followed his wake but naming his own landfalls, 
    Helluland, Markland and Vinland the Good. Thorfinn Karlsefni attempted 
    permanent settlement at Hop in Vinland. Constant skirmishes with the 
    natives contributed to the abandonment of Hop after three years and the 
    saga record retreats into relative silence on the Vinland activities. 
    Attempts to interpret the Zeno map and Nicholo Zeno’s 16th century 
    report of his ancestor’s westward explorations with the Earl of Orkney 
    have occupied English speaking investigators since its publication by 
    Hakluyt in 1582. The leading candidate for the identity of the Orkney 
    leader is Henry Sinclair, Earl of the Norse controlled Orkney Islands. 
    The controversy continues with contemporary members of Clan Sinclair 
    Henry’s greatest champions.
    Following the <i>Da vinci Code</i> a spate of Templar related books have proliferated.

    Other than brief references by the saga men and rune carvers, we are left 
    with a few Atlantic coast clam shells found in a Danish midden, a chunk 
    of Rhode Island anthracite coal found in Greenland, a Norse penny in a 
    native context in Maine and a Norse spindle whorl in the artifact 
    collection unearthed at L’Anse aux Meadows, in Newfoundland for verified
    physical evidence.

  <h3>LOOSE THREADS IN A TAPESTRY OF STONE:</h3>
  <p>THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE NEWPORT TOWER</p>
  <p>
    Only a rugged stone apse, its back braced against the wind and Atlantic waves, 
    remains of the early Medieval Norse round church of Orphir on the west 
    coast of the Orkney Islands. The puzzling arcaded round church in the 
    village of Lanleff in northern Brittany purports to be a Templar 
    sanctuary, but its style betrays a construction date before the founding
    of that religious order. The octagonal tower in the abandoned Monastery
    of Saint Bavo in Ghent hides its upper story above a stone groined 
    vault. The Knights of the Order of Christ chose the octagon for 
    their altar tower in the Templar convent in Tomar, Portugal. Both of the
    twin towers on the grounds of the Sulpician Grand Seminary in Montreal,
    Canada features a fireplace with a flue exiting on the side wall, while
    the other has two fireplaces with the same unusual flue arrangement. 
    Sir Edward Peyto’s elegant open-arcaded, round windmill dominates the 
    rolling hills around Chesterton in Warwickshire, England.
  </p>
  <p>
    All of 
    these buildings have been suggested as the inspiration or even prototype
    for the Newport Tower. Ranging in style from rude and rugged to 
    the gracious Renaissance work of Inigo Jones, these buildings have more 
    in common than circles and arches. Whether built in the eleventh century
    or the seventeenth, they would have been constructed with the same 
    tools, the same brute strength of the workmen who spent the same amount 
    of time preparing and completing the construction, and struggling with 
    many of the same technical problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    But 
    there were differences in Newport. Though perched high above a protected
    bay, this Tower’s builder was on the wrong side of the wide Atlantic. 
    In this investigation, I follow in the wake of a long line of worthy 
    researchers on both sides of the ocean whose imaginations have been 
    fired by the enigmatic icon in Newport’s Touro Park.

  <h3>EXTINCT LANGUAGE REVEALS CELTIC ORIGINS</h3>
  <p>
    Although the Roman conquest led to the extinction of the Gaulish language 2,000 years ago,
    a half dozen rare, surviving Gaulish/Latin bilingual inscriptions have enabled scholars to
    trace the origins of the Celtic language and many other European languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to the study, Celtic branched in two directions from an Indo-European mother language
    around 3200 B.C. One version, Gaulish, which is also called Continental Celtic, stayed within the
    European mainland. A second, British version, referred to as Insular Celtic, moved in a single wave to
    Britain. Although the Roman conquest led to the extinction of the Gaulish language 2,000 years ago,
    a half dozen rare, surviving Gaulish/Latin bilingual inscriptions have enabled scholars to trace the
    origins of the Celtic language and many other European languages.

  <h3>ACROSS THE ATLANTIC, A NINETEENTH CENTURY VIEW</h3>
  <p>
    Jan Barstad, President of <a href="https://www.chronognostic.org/" target="_blank">Chronognostic Research Foundation</a>,
    in her research on source material for the 2001 excavation at the Newport 
    Tower, found this tantalizing document based on Papal Bulls from 
    the Vatican Archives. Despite the obvious errors and the difficulty in 
    interpreting the unfamiliar Norse original reports rendered into Church 
    Latin and then into French, we felt that an English version would be a 
    valuable contribution to our understanding of a 19<sup>th</sup> century view of Pre-Columbian America.

  <h3>Renegade Vikings</h3>
  <img alt="Vikinggen cover  lading 034" src="IrishMonksRenegadeVikings/Vikinggen_cover__lading_034.jfif">
  <p>
    Viking lore tells of long migrations 
    of Germanic tribes into Scandinavia and the eventual melding with the 
    native heirs of the red paint people. I believe that Norse mythology 
    reflects folk memory of real events. The united body that would one day 
    be known as the Vikings, took to the sea very early and they traveled 
    far and wide. The Swedes went east down the Russian rivers to 
    Miklagård—the great city of Constantine. Ingvar took his East Vikings as
    far as the Caspian Sea. His story is recorded in a series of memorial 
    rune stones in Södermanland, Sweden. The West Vikings, the scourge of 
    Europe, swarmed over all the island
  </p>
  <p>
    The North Atlantic voyager who should 
    be considered the discoverer of the New World was Gunbjorn, who fell 
    afoul of Iceland and emerged from the fog on the rocky skerries off the 
    east coast of Greenland sometime in the late ninth century. North 
    American settlement, for Greenland is certainly geologically and 
    geographically part of North America, began with the arrival of the 
    outlawed Eric the red, with his band of settlers in 985 in the fjords of
    the west coast of Greenland. This settlement, known as the “Eastern 
    Settlement” spawned another outpost three hundred miles to the north 
    which was known as the “Western Settlement”. The two settlements 
    struggled to survive until the Western Settlement was abandoned around 
    1340 and the “east” settlement disappeared during the little ice age of 
    the mid-16<sup>th</sup> century. The fate of Vinland the Good is not so clearly documented.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both the Greenlander’s saga and Erick’s saga tell of Bjarne Herjolfsson’s wind 
    and fog-swept coasting west of his intended Greenland landfall. Leif 
    Erickson later followed his wake but naming his own landfalls, 
    Helluland, Markland and Vinland the Good. Members of the Erickson clan 
    continued exploring and his sister-in-law with her second husband, 
    Thorfinn Karlsefni attempted permanent settlement at Hop in Vinland. 
    Constant skirmishes with the natives contributed to the abandonment of 
    Hop after three years and the saga record retreats into relative silence
    on the Vinland activities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other than brief references by the saga men and rune carvers, we are left with a 
    few Atlantic coast clam shells found in a Danish midden, a chunk of 
    Rhode Island anthracite coal found in Greenland, a Norse penny in a 
    native context in Maine and a Norse spindle whorl in the artifact 
    collection unearthed at L’Anse aux Meadows, in Newfoundland for verified
    physical evidence.
  </p>
  <p>
    The “context for controversy” emerged back in the 1830’s when Carl Christian Rafn, 
    Danish antiquarian, scholar, professor, Royal Councilor and possessor of
    formidable knowledge of the repertoire of Old Norse literature, 
    published his Antiquae Americanae. In it, he presented a forceful case 
    for Norse presence along the New England coast which included the 
    Dighton writing rock and the Newport Tower. This enthusiastic support 
    set off a flurry of interest, explorations, discoveries and proofs in a 
    search for Leif’s Vinland. Armed with this or that theory, amateurs and 
    professionals alike scoured the countryside looking for clues, 
    especially runic inscriptions. Since those days words, phrases, pleas 
    and prayers have been discerned carved on stone in a myriad of languages
    from a myriad of times to bolster the faith of diffusionists.

  <p>
    The earliest extant version of <i>The Voyage of Saint Brendan</i>
    was recorded around 900 AD. There are over 100 manuscripts of the story
    across Europe, as well as many additional translations. <i>The Voyage of Saint Brendan</i>
    is an overtly Christian narrative, but also contains narratives of 
    natural phenomena and fantastical events and places, which appealed to a
    broad populace. The Voyage of Saint Brendan contains many parallels and
    inter-textual references to the Voyage of
    <i><a title="The Voyage of Bran" href="https://neara.org/wiki/The_Voyage_of_Bran" target="_blank">Bran</a></i>
    and the Voyage of <i><a title="Máel Dúin" href="https://neara.org/wiki/M%C3%A1el_D%C3%BAin" target="_blank">Máel Dúin</a></i>.
  </p>

  <p>Chapter Synopsis:</p>
  <p>Saint Barrid tells of his visit to the Island of Paradise, which prompts Brendan to go in search of the isle.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Brendan assembles 14 monks to accompany him.</li>
  <li>They fast at three-day intervals for 40 days, and visit Saint Enda for three days and three nights.</li>
  <li>Three latecomers join the group. <i>They interfere with Brendan's sacred numbers.</i></li>
  <li>They find an island with a dog, mysterious hospitality (no people, but food left out), and an Ethiopian devil.</li>
  <li>One latecomer admits to having stolen from
  the mysterious island, Brendan exorcises the Ethiopian devil from the 
  latecomer, latecomer dies and is buried.</li>
  <li>They find an island with a boy who brings them bread and water.</li>
  <li>They find an island of sheep, eat some, and stay for Holy Week (before Easter).</li>
  <li>They find the island of Jasconius, have Easter Mass, and hunt whales and fish.</li>
  <li>They find an island that is the Paradise of Birds, and the birds sing psalms and praise the Lord.</li>
  <li>They find the island of the monks of Ailbe, with magic loaves, no aging, and complete silence. They celebrate Christmas.</li>
  <li>A long voyage after Lent. They find an 
  island with a well, and drinking the water puts them to sleep for 1, 2, 
  or 3 days based on the number of cups each man drank.</li>
  <li>They find a "coagulated" sea.</li>
  <li>They return to the islands of Sheep, 
  Jasconius, and the Paradise of Birds. A bird prophesies that the men 
  must continue this year-long cycle for seven years before they will be 
  holy enough to reach the Island of Paradise.</li>
  <li>A sea creature approaches the boat, but 
  God shifts the sea to protect the men. Another sea creature comes, chops
  the first into three pieces, and leaves. The men eat the dead sea 
  creature.</li>
  <li>They find an island of 3 choirs of 
  anchorites (monks), who give them fruit, and the second latecomer stays 
  behind when the others leave.</li>
  <li>They find an island of grapes, and stayed for 40 days.</li>
  <li>They find a gryphon and a bird battle. The gryphon dies.</li>
  <li>To the monastery at Ailbe again for Christmas.</li>
  <li>The sea is clear, and many threatening fish circle their boat, but God protects them.</li>
  <li>They find an island, but when they light a fire, the island sinks; it is actually a whale.</li>
  <li>They pass a "silver pillar wrapped in a net" in the sea.</li>
  <li>They pass an island of blacksmiths, who throw slag at them.</li>
  <li>They find a volcano, and the third latecomer is taken by demons down to Hell.</li>
  <li>They find Judas sitting unhappily on a 
  cold, wet rock in the middle of the sea, and discover that this is his 
  respite from Hell for Sundays and feast days. Brendan protects Judas 
  from the demons of Hell for one night.</li>
  <li>They find an island where Paul the Hermit 
  has lived a perfect monastic life for 60 years. He wears nothing but 
  hair and is fed by an otter.</li>
  <li>They return to the island of Sheep, Jasconius, and the Paradise of Birds.</li>
  <li>They find the Promised Land of the Saints.</li>
  <li>They return home, and Brendan dies.</li>
