  <h2>The First Americans</h2>
  <img src="FirstAmericans/FIRSTAMERICANSsm.jfif" alt="FIRST AMERICANS">
  <p>
    Actually the first points found in undisputed connection with an extinct animal 
    was in Folsom, NM in 1908. Not until an excavation was done in 1926 was a
    broken spear point found in connection with the extinct giant bison. 
    Soon after more of the distinctive fluted points were found near Clovis,
    NM under mammoth bones and the name Clovis has since been applied to 
    this culture that had developed a life style enabling it to prosper and 
    spread.
  </p>
  <p>
    The typical Clovis point has a “flute” that
    can only be made by a very experienced flint knapper at the end of the 
    process. Evidence of an unusual technique called “overshot” results in a
    very thin cross section. As more sites with this distinctive culture were
    being found in the Southeast more questions remained unanswered about 
    how humans could have survived in the period during and after the 
    melting of the glaciers in the “ice free' corridor. Tundra like 
    conditions do not provide food for either people or animals and yet 
    Monte Verde was discovered near the tip of South America with a 14,000 
    year old date.

    The new book by Dennis Stanford and Bruce 
    Bradley, Across Atlantic Ice, the Origin of America's Clovis Culture 
    presents a powerful argument for their hypothesis that during the Late 
    Glacial Maximum (LGM) about 18,000, people from the Solutrean culture of
    Spain and France brought with them a stone tool technique that spread 
    across the continent and developed into the Clovis culture.

    “The Center for the Study of the First Americans fosters research and
    public interest in the Peopling of the Americas. The Center, an 
    integral part of the department of Anthropology at Texas A&amp;M 
    University,promotes interdisciplinary scholarly dialogue among physical,
    geological, biological and social scientists.”

  <h3>Cultural Diffusion</h3>
  <p>
    The term ‘diffusionist’ was first used in 1893 to denote a scholar who believed 
    that most folklore was borrowed from an Old World center of high 
    culture, such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, or India (Oxford English Dictionary
    1971). The term initially contrasted with it was ‘evolutionist,’ 
    meaning, in this context, a folklorist who maintained that most 
    traditional oral narratives originated in the area in which they were 
    current. But, because the term evolutionist was more often employed to 
    designate someone supporting a nontheistic theory of biological 
    speciation, the word ‘inventionist’ came to replace evolutionist as the 
    label for a believer in predominantly autonomous local cultural 
    development.
  </p>
  <p>
    The distinction between diffusionism and inventionism became progressively 
    sharper as the two positions polarized. Increasingly, adherents of each 
    school saw themselves as defensively compelled to refute the 
    misinterpretations of the other school. In this respect, the relation 
    between diffusionism and inventionism was much like that between 
    evolutionism and creationism with regard to the origin of species, or 
    that between uniformitarianism and catastrophism with regard to the 
    history of the earth. In all three cases, polemics grew at the expense 
    of mutual understanding.

  <h3>Clovis and Beyond</h3>
  <p>Report on the Santa Fe Conference, October 1999</p>
  <p>
    The Peopling of the Americas! Now there is a topic guaranteed to generate vigorous arguments among
    archaeologists, each of whom is convinced that he or she has a piece of the truth.
    The odd thing is that perhaps each one does, and the place to discover this was in Santa Fe,
    New Mexico, over the Halloween weekend, 1999, at the Clovis and Beyond conference.
    Co-sponsored by the Center for the Study of the First Americans, Clovis and Beyond attracted
    more then 1400 archaeologists and interested lay people.

  <h3>Books</h3>
  <p><i>Across Atlantic Ice</i>, by Standford, Dennis &amp; Bruce Bradley; University of California Press</p>
  <p>The Origin of America's Clovis Culture</p>
  <p>
    Who were the first humans to inhabit North 
    America? According to the now familiar story, mammal hunters entered the
    continent some 12,000 years ago via a land bridge that spanned the 
    Bering Sea. Distinctive stone tools belonging to the Clovis culture 
    established the presence of these early New World people. But are the 
    Clovis tools Asian in origin? Drawing from original archaeological 
    analysis, paleoclimatic research, and genetic studies, noted 
    archaeologists Dennis J. Stanford and Bruce A. Bradley challenge the old
    narrative and, in the process, counter traditional—and often 
    subjective—approaches to archaeological testing for historical 
    relatedness. The authors apply rigorous scholarship to a hypothesis that
    places the technological antecedents of Clovis in Europe and posits 
    that the first Americans crossed the Atlantic by boat and arrived 
    earlier than previously thought. Supplying archaeological and 
    oceanographic evidence to support this assertion, the book dismantles 
    the old paradigm while persuasively linking Clovis technology with the 
    culture of the Solutrean people who occupied France and Spain more than 
    20,000 years ago.
