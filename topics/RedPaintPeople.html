  <h2>The Red Paint People</h2>

    The Red Paint People lived in Maine and the Maritimes about 4000 years ago. They
    are so called because they used the mineral red ocher in burial 
    ceremonies, sprinkling quantities of it on the dead and over all 
    the gifts they placed in the graves. They are considered to be 
    part of the Archaic Period that ended about 3000 years ago with 
    the advent of the Ceramic Period.

    THE RED-PAINT PEOPLE OF MAINE
    by Warren K. Moorehead
  </p>
  <p>
    It is rather strange that in Maine there should recently have been discovered 
  the evidences of an unusual culture of considerable age. We are 
  accustomed to regard the South, the Mississippi valley, and the 
  Southwest as sections in which one expects to be confronted by 
  archeological problems; but it is in the most easterly portion of the 
  United States that we have now found indications of a culture different 
  from that existing anywhere else in this country. Excepting the strange 
  remains of the cave-people of the Ozark mountains, explored by Dr 
  Charles Peabody and the writer' in 1904, perhaps nothing found in the 
  United States inrecent years is comparable in interest with the problem 
  of the "Red-paint People" of the lower Penobscot valley.
