    The action of the glacier also left New England’s soil permeated with 
    stones, which needed to be cleared before planting could begin. They 
    were often tossed in piles or built into the many stone walls we see 
    scattered through the countryside. Some of the rock piles were used as 
    boundary markers and recorded in early land records as “stake and 
    stones” or heap of stones. Some stone piles that we see are too 
    carefully constructed to fit these categories. We know, for instance 
    that the Vikings built stone cairns as memorials or burials mounds. 
    Native Americans, also built memorial cairns, each wayfarer adding a 
    donation stone as he passed by. Archaeologists have found evidence of 
    Indian burials under stone piles. Other piles are arranged in an array 
    that indicates viewing important astronomical events.
    Additional investigation may provide answers to yet unknown uses of these constructions.

  <h3>VERMONT PLATFORM CAIRNS</h3>
  <p>by Norman E. Muller</p>
  <p>
    One curious lithic feature that the author has been intrigued about, and which may even be more
    significant than stone chambers, is what is called a platform cairn. This is a large, waist-high stone
    platform of dry stone masonry, sometimes measuring twenty or more feet to a side, and in form either
    rectangular, square, oval or some other shape. If constructed on a steep slope, the downhill side of the
    platform can be upwards of ten or more feet high, whereas the uphill side is waist high or less. The top
    surface of these platforms is usually flat and covered with smaller stones called paving, though a
    rounded surface is not unheard of, as the reader will soon discover.
