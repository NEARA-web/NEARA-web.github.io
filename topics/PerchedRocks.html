    Glacial action on the New England Landscape left many stones in unusual 
    positions which geologists call glacial erratic. Some are so 
    easily explained. There are gigantic boulders perched precariously on 
    supporting stones from a different source and placed in a defined 
    geometric pattern. Some are sited so as to mark solar alignments for 
    major calendar events.

  <h3>THE PERCHED BOULDERS -- GLACIER OR MAN-MADE IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE?</h3>
  <p>Vyacheslav Mizin</p>
  <p>
    DISTRIBUTION AND HYPOTHESES This article is intended to acquaint readers with concepts surrounding the distribution, origin, and associated
    cult of perched boulders, objects which remain a large riddle in both of the world’s hemispheres. The two basic
    theories concerning the formation of perched boulders are that they were created by glaciers, or were manmade.
    They are distributed in Ice Age areas of North America and Europe. Pedestal and perched boulders
    can have one, two, three, or more supports. Rather frequently, boulders are placed in such a way that they
    can shake. In some areas, perched boulders have special place names.
    It is interesting to note that the quantity of boulders in Europe decreases from North to South,
    according to the course of the glaciers. The challenge in this study is to determine how to
    properly compare obvious attributes of boulders in order to determine if they were glacier or man-made. Asking
    the right questions is essential if we are to obtain needed clues as the boulders’ creation:
    What are the origins of the cults* associated with perched boulders?
    What were the reasons or purposes for erecting perched boulders?
    Is there an ethnographic similarity among the native peoples in these regions?

    THE PERCHED BOULDERS</a>

  <h3>A FIELD REPORT: SOME BALANCED ROCKS IN MASSACHUSETTS</h3>
  <p>By Jim Moore</p>

    An incalculable number of boulders were left in the wake of great shields 
    of ice retreating northward during the last glacial epoch. A great
    number of these came to rest on bedrock surfaces as 'perched' boulders.
    Some of these are "foreigners" in the sense that they are a different 
    bedrock unit than the native rock on which they lay. However, some came 
    to rest in positions of a more precarious nature that caught the eye and
    imagination of early inhabitants from the Native Americans down to more
    modern day colonial settlers. Even before glacial theories became
    fact these rocks were oft times discussed amongst early geologists such
    as Amherst's Edward Hitchcock in his two treatises on Massachusetts's 
    geology from 1835 and 1841. Hitchcock mused about the great 
    quantities of water necessary to move such large rocks and wrote, 
    "bowlders are by far the most instructive index of diluvial agency in 
    Massachusetts."

    The six sites discussed represent what I 
    arbitrarily feel show the more exemplary examples of these 
    features. Size, minimum point of contact, and how the rock might 
    be tipped are the considerations I used in rocks that demonstrate the 
    effect/illusion of being balanced. Indeed, early histories record 
    these rocks as being capable of some limited movement thus gaining names
    such as Tipping Rock, Rolling Rock, Teetering Rock, etc. In almost all 
    the cases I have personally observed, no movement was possible in the 
    present time. Additionally, I have a couple of examples of 
    'doublets' or boulders upon a boulder that represent their own unique 
    form of a balancing act.
