  <h2>Eastern Woodland Indians</h2>
  <img alt="woodland rn-27f15" src="EasternWoodlandIndians/woodland_rn-27f15.jfif">
  <p>
    The Eastern Woodland Indian culture is found in the region of eastern north
    America east of the great plains and Mississippi River and from 
    Newfoundland in the north to Florida and the Gulf Coast to the south. In
    the northeast as many as 60 indigenous groups spoke dialects of either 
    Algonquian or Iroquoian languages. Their lifestyles were that of 
    hunter-gatherer in the north taking advantage of the abundance along the
    coasts and waterways to a more sedentary agricultural base in the 
    south.

  <h3>NIPMUC WAYS: THE CREATOR</h3>

    Native spirituality prior to 
    colonization varied widely in the elements and symbols of ceremony, 
    ritual and expression. Nevertheless, the basic precepts and 
    understanding ofancient cosmologies in relation to the acceptance of a 
    Creator Father and the Earth as Mother are common to the indigenous 
    nations of North and South America. This idea is also basic to virtually
    all so-called primitive cultures in Africa, Australia, etc., including,
    of course, Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
  </p>
  <p>
    Among the Algonquian nations which include all southern New England tribes, 
    excluding the Pequots, minor variations oc­curred according to 
    environmental differences. For example, to the north, wild forage and 
    game animals made up the bulk of the food supply—whereas along the 
    Blackstone Valley area and our surrounding environs, agriculture 
    provided the major portion of the year-round menu. Turkey, fish, venison
    and other meats, both fresh and dried, supplemented, but were not 
    central to the diet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Locally we have three names in our language signifying Cre­ator. They are 
    Cautantowitz (Great Creator in One), Manitoo-oo (Sacred One or Great 
    Spirit), and Kitchtan (which compares to The Lord God, in English). 
    There are also many titles identifying the presence of God in His 
    creations and this was the cause of the Puritan colonists’ claim that 
    there were from 14 to 32 different “gods” which natives worshipped. For 
    instance, many natural but unusual phenomena were called 
    Manitoo-ok—meaning a gift of Creator. To foreign immigrants just 
    learning the native language, it appeared that this designation 
    addressed a god, rather than simply crediting God as maker of the site. 
    Tohcocummupaug manitoo-oc means “sacred spring,” rather than, “this 
    spring is a god.” When observing an exceptionally beautiful view or 
    being fortunate enough to observe an eagle circling above, it would be 
    appropriate to say Manitoo-ok to give credit to, and express thanks for 
    God who pro­vides the blessings we enjoy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many mythical beings inhabit legends with a lesson or pur­pose that gives 
    them a status similar to Santa Claus or the tooth fairy. Our “Santa” is a
    venerable spirit believed to dwell among the evergreens. It is he who 
    guides hunters and fishermen to game and leads foragers to productive 
    berry patches and abundant tasty greens from the woods and meadows. His 
    name is Nikkomo, which also means feasting and dancing. The winter 
    solstice time ofgiving is called Nikkomo.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the favorites of Indian children is Granny Squannit who is one of the many 
    little people (mukkeuhwesugg) who are sometimes seen for just a moment 
    as they go about their business. As children we were told that ifwe 
    couldn’t finish a meal we should take the remains out a way from the 
    home for the little people. Usually a chipmunk, bird or squirrel found 
    it first, but it was always fun to think that one day we might just see 
    one ofthe little ones or even Granny Squannit herself, ifwe were 
    particularly well-behaved and respected our elders.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then there is Hobomook! Here in the northeast Hobomook is our coyote or heyoka 
    (clown) figure. He earned a terrible reputa­tion among the colonists who
    perceived him as an Indian version of the devil or Satan. Not so. 
    Someone walking along a trail might be distracted by Hobomook causing 
    them to trip and fall over a rock or root, perhaps skinning both knees 
    and elbows in the act. You might say “what a mean thing to do”—but 
    unknown to the hiker there was a rattlesnake crossing the path ahead and
    the fall kept them from being bitten. Another “trick” was to cause 
    events that might bring two alienated friends together in a situation 
    that would restore good feelings between them. A wise person might be 
    compared to Hobomook, as was the case with Massasoit’s highest ranking 
    council member who served as ambassador to the Plymouth Colony. History 
    records his name as Hobomook.

    That the breath oflife within the body was (and is) considered spirit, is evident
    in the Nipmuc language. The term chippe means separated or apart; 
    cheepie refers to a dead body being separate from the life. Chepeck is 
    the word (or one of the words) for dead.
  </p>
  <p>
    While some colonists believed that Indians were less than hu­man and even that it 
    was God’s will that the “pagan” tribes should be destroyed as agents of 
    the devil, there were those such as Roger Williams who recognized the 
    important similarities of native con­cepts and the deeper truth ofthe 
    Bible, particularly the teachings of Christ. Williams demonstrated 
    Christianity without proselytizing, and the Nipmucs and Narragansetts 
    were among the first to accept Christianity of their own free will, 
    rather than at the point of a gun or sword. As a result the little 
    Indian Church in Charlestown, RI remains active today, holding Sunday 
    services, tribal gatherings and related activities. In recent years, the
    United Methodist Church has been highly supportive of American Indians 
    and currently has the largest native membership of any denomination.
  </p>
  <p>
    In spite of the fact that speaking in a native language was frowned upon, and in 
    some cases actually unlawful, the work of Roger Williams, John Elliot, 
    John and Josiah Cotton and most of all, James Printer (of Hassanamisset 
    and Natick) in compiling dic­tionaries and grammar books for use in 
    translating the Bible into the local dialects of the Algonquian language
    is invaluable today. Thanks to the “praying Indians” we have the tools 
    to preserve our language, which along with a land base are the keys to 
    maintaining cultural identity. And so it is that in our tongue, as well 
    as in many others, we can offer the familiar prayer that begins 
    ...Nooshunkees­ukqut quittiannantanmunach koowesunonk: Our Father Who 
    art in Heaven...
