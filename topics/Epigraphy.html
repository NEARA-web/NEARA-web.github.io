  <h2>Epigraphy</h2>

  <p>
    Epigraphy is the study of ancient inscriptions, usually found on hard surfaces 
    such as stone. NEARA members use epigraphic study and comparison to 
    study early transoceanic contacts in the Americas. The 
    majority opinion of American archaeologists is that there are no 
    authentic Old World inscriptions in the Americas and that none should be
    expected because there were no proven foreign contacts except by the 
    Norse at Newfoundland. Even the Norse inscriptions are considered 
    spurious by opponents of early voyaging. Evidence indicating early sea 
    travel is not welcomed by those already convinced that it did not or 
    could not have happened. Common arguments against early contact are as 
    follows:
    The oceans were barriers to travel, not highways, and people simply lacked 
    the capacity to sail or paddle more than a few miles from shore before 
    the exploits of the great European navigators of the 15th century.

  <h3>EPIGRAPHY, THE STUDY OF ANCIENT INSCRIPTIONS</h3>
  <p>
    Epigraphy is the study of ancient inscriptions, usually found on hard surfaces 
    such as stone. NEARA members use epigraphy to study contacts between 
    Americans and other people before the late 15th century.

  <p>
    Some archaeologists say that the case for early voyages to America rests 
    almost entirely on epigraphic evidence (e.g., Lepper 1995), but 
    inscriptions account for only a small part of the evidence. The 
    annotated bibliography <i>Pre-Columbian Contact with the Americas Across the Oceans</i>
    by Sorenson and Raish (1996), the best key to the literature on 
    Pre-Columbian contact, has more than 5000 entries but only about a 
    hundred that concern epigraphy. With so much evidence of other kinds, 
    the presence of a few Old World inscriptions is to be expected.
