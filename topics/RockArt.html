    Petroglyphs are found world-wide and usually are prehistoric; the term refers to a 
    rock surface that is incised, carved or abraded. Pictographs are images 
    drawn or painted on a rock face and both types fall into the category of
    rock art with many examples found in New England.

  <h3>ROCK ART - PETROGLYPHS AND PICTOGRAPHS</h3>
  <p>
    Since time immemorial, Native 
    Americans used a symbol-based form of writing. Some of these symbols 
    were used to convey messages to others passing at a later time; some 
    symbols were used to record events important to the tribe's history. 
    These symbols fall into two main categories: Pictographs, which are 
    painted on rock or ledge and Petroglyphs, which are carved, 
    chipped or scratched into the stone.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a North American archaeologist and the editor of the recent <i>Handbook of Rock Art Research</i>,
    David Whitley (2001:23) asserts that the term “rock art” has been in 
    use for “roughly 100 years,” at least within the “Western intellectual 
    tradition.” Yet, he offers no citations to support his claim. Judging 
    from the bibliographies of major syntheses of North America, the term 
    “rock art” was not used until the early 1960s (Whitley 2001:43-51, c.f.,
    Grant 1967:156-170; Mallery 1893:778-807; Wellmann 1979:173-196). In 
    fact, the first continental synthesis began with idea of “writing,” not 
    rock art (e.g., Mallery 1893).

  <p>
    How are rock art and writing defined? 
    Why was the concept of writing abandoned in favor of the idea of rock 
    art in North America? What may be discerned from tribal accounts? Is the
    notion of rock art appropriate in application to ancestral Native North
    America?

  <h3>PAINTED DREAMS, NATIVE AMERICAN ROCK ARTAN EXAMINATION OF A TRADITION</h3>
  <p>
    Painted Dreams, Native American Rock Art by Thor Conway, a curly headed, blonde fellow, whose daughters
    are named Amber Wahsayah, Tara Nowahtin and Cedar Geegahkwah - which shows where his heart is.
    I decided to read this one first to get it out of the way 
    form the really "good" stuff. As I read along, I found thatConway's
    emphasis was on the vision quests of the native people expressed in the
    paintings and carvings we call rock art, an integral part of the sacred
    earth. Two general terms are defined: pictograph refers to a paintingon
    rock, while petroglyph refers to a carving into the rock's surface. 
    Shamans who entered trance states to gain access to the spirit world 
    produced large amounts of North American rock art. Numerous motifs are 
    found on the dreaming rocks: handprints, zigzag lines, sun 
    symbols and cupules.

  <h3>ORAL TRADITIONS AND NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN LITERACY:ROCK ART, WRITING, AND THE CADMUS MYTHREX WEEKS</h3>
  <p>
    North American Indian varieties of writing are found on many types of media, 
    but those put to rocks are most enduring. Rather than accept tribal 
    accounts, many contemporary North American historians, anthropologists, 
    and archaeologists prefer the term “rock art.” Ideas of rock art and 
    writing have important implications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rock art may be defined in any number of ways that are best suited to researchers’ 
    structural, technological, semantic, cognitive, contextual, taphonomic, 
    and/or functional approaches.
