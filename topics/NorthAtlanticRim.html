	<h2>The North Atlantic Rim</h2>
  <img alt="north atlantic rim icon" src="NorthAtlanticRim/north_atlantic_rim_icon.jfif">
  <p>
    As the ice melted, historians and 
    archaeologists talk of immigrants moving north into the newly exposed 
    rich northern tundra both in Europe and North America, but it was not 
    until Norwegian archaeologist, Guthorm Gjessing an ardent diffusionist 
    noticed a striking similarity between the cultural remains in Norway and
    the Maritime Archaic or Red Paint people of Maine and the Canadian 
    Maritimes that the Atlantic rim connection was made. Style and 
    techniques of worked stone and the use of skin boats for deep sea 
    fishing and red ochre in burials were common. Impossible, some say, but 
    others- usually those with salt in their blood- think otherwise and see 
    the fish laden pack ice as a bridge not a barrier to traveling around 
    the North Atlantic rim.

	<h4>Barrier or Bridge?</h4>
  <p>Suzanne O. Carlson</p>

    For Sea rovers, the highways are marked by waves below and clouds above.
    Aided by the sun and the stars, we can guess that the earliest skippers followed
    the icy rim edge in wooden dugouts or skin clad craft.
    Food was abundant on the edge of the pack ice: seal, walrus, fish, big 
    and little, birds and their eggs. As the rebounding land emerged, other 
    ocean-loving mammals followed the fish, otters, and the great white bear
    appeared. Arctic berries clung close to the ground while millions of 
    cawing sea birds clung to bare rocky cliffs.
