  <p>
    Over the years stone chambers have been dismissed as nothing more than 
    farmers’ root cellars. Why do some have long narrow entrance passages? 
    In some, the light of the rising or setting sun creeps in illuminating 
    the rear wall only during the summer or winter solstice. Many chambers 
    are located near rivers or streams, while others are clustered in one 
    area.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet they are important examples of 
    antiquities in New England. They are conspicuous as constructions and 
    yet little or nothing is known about their history. The chambers are 
    widespread, occurring in densities from as many as 200 chambers in 
    Putnam County New York, to as few as two or three in the state of Maine.
    As can be seen in the photos section, two or three architectural styles
    are quite common: flat fronted, corridor fronted, and underground. 
    Other chambers may not fit any of these patterns.

  <p>Some facts are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Chambers are made from large stones, with both corbelled or 
      post-and-lintel ceiling structures. They are usually built on bedrock.
    </li>
    <li>
      Some are recent with regular, smoothly cut stones. Some have been modified recently including added brick and mortar.
    </li>
    <li>
      Some chambers have been reported to be ancient, based on with carbon-14 dating of charcoal.
    </li>
    <li>
      Some chambers allow viewing of specific horizon events, such as solstices, equinoxes, heliacal rising of the Pleiades, etc.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    There are three extreme views as to the 
    nature of Stone Chambers. One is the conventional view that they are 
    just colonial period root cellars. A second is the speculative view that
    they were built as an extension of the same Neolithic culture that 
    built passage tombs and "beehives" in Ireland. A third is that the 
    chambers are part of Native American spirituality, a New England version
    of the Kiva. There is enough variety among the chambers to support any 
    one or all of these views.

  <p>
    Stone chambers are fragile and are being destroyed at a steady rate.

  <h3>FROM DISASTER TO DELIGHT</h3>
  <p>
    The 1997 NEARA spring meeting was held in nearby Woodstock, Connecticut. 
    The owner gave me permission to show this classic, oval-shaped, drywall 
    chamber as part of our traditional Sunday field trip. Approximately 30 
    fellow members gathered around as I opened the door. Unbeknownst to me, 
    the broken lintel had sagged more and was only being supported by the 
    door and frame. Creak, crack, crunch! As
    the door opened, the two lintel halves plummeted to the ground and the 
    entire left supporting wall crumbled to my feet . I turned to see the 
    crowd gasping in unison. It was truly a preservationist’s nightmare.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is the story of disaster to delight as the chamber was restored to its original condition.
