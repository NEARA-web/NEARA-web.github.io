    Over 6,000 languages are spoken around the world, yet the number of written 
    languages has not been determined. Mandarin Chinese boasts the most 
    speakers,with Spanish and English second and third. The Americas count 
    up to 1,000 indigenous languages and some researchers suggest that there
    may have been up to 2,000 in the more distant past, with Mayan glyphs 
    the only "written system" with the exception of the controversial 
    Canadian Micmac hieroglyphs. However pictorial systems (picture writing)
    whether on stone bark or skin were common among native populations.

    Within NEARA's purview, there are scattered examples of purported near or 
    Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Germanic and Celtic inscriptions. These 
    have mostly been deemed "impossible" or outright hoaxes, but there is 
    compelling evidence for authentic examples as well. The two categories 
    that have drawn the most attention and most controversy derive from the 
    broader subjects of both Norse and Celtic contact with the Americas. Any
    number of carved stones have been interpreted as being Irish or Celt 
    Iberian Ogham while others suggest variations on Norse Runic alphabets.

	<h3>ANICIENT GREEK CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC</h3>
  <p>INFLUENCES IN ATLANTIC NORTH AMERICA by John Cooper</p>
  <p>
    "Linguistic archaeology" is what John 
    Cooper called his word dig as he researches the meanings and 
    associations of words in some native languages of New england and 
    Canada's Maritimes. Delving into, in particular, Abenaki, Malaseet and 
    Micmac. cooperfinds more than a coincidental correspondence with some 
    words, place names and concepts in classical Greek. He wonders if there 
    could have been some Greek influence on the Micmac hieroglyphs, 
    concievably derived from Lybian Greeks in the period around 500 B.C.

    ASLIP was founded in 1986 to 
    encourage international, interdisciplinary information sharing, 
    discussion, and debate among biogeneticists, paleoanthropologists, 
    archaeologists, and historical linguists on questions relating to the 
    emerging synthesis on language origins and ancestral human spoken 
    languages. According to the founder of ASLIP, Harold C. Fleming, "All 
    known human spoken languages [probably] are genetically related to each 
    other as descendants of the first invention[s]--Ur-Human or 
    Proto-Language. One test of that is to show a taxonomy of human 
    languages --convincing to linguists-- which makes possible a universal 
    family tree and ultimately the reconstructions of major cultural events 
    associated with the evolution of modern people. Another corollary is 
    that the complex evolution of physical humans --population movements and
    shared mutations-- can be figured out and related to a universal family
    tree which can be dated and located to its roots. Finally, tests of 
    these theories can be made through archaeological discoveries..."
    "The goal of our enterprise is to seek the truth as it pertains to the 
    emerging synthesis about modern human origins. [ASLIP and its journal,] 
    Mother Tongue,[are] not committed to any single proposition..."
