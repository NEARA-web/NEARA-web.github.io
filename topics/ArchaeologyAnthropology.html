  <p>
    NEARA is not an archeological society, but evolving trends and available 
    academic and scientific research impacts all our studies. We have 
    sponsored research and excavations supervised by accredited 
    archaeologists. Many of our members have participated in projects 
    sponsored by amateur archaeological societies, state and local agencies 
    agencies and historical commissions as well as projects under contract 
    with private owners.

  <h3>BIG DIG IN BINGHAM : STUDY OF A MAINE CAIRN FIELD</h3>
  <p>WHY CONDUCT A PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATION?</p>
  <p>
    When we realized that we had a well-preserved group of stone mounds, a 
    supportive owner, and a site that was readily accessible, NEARA, through
    Ros Strong, approached Deborah Wilson, an open minded Maine 
    archaeologist, to see if she would be interested in supervising an 
    investigation of the site. She was, and suggested that her colleague 
    Mark Hedden, a specialist in Maine rock art, be included in the team 
    along with NEARA volunteers.

  <h3>Weekends in the Soil</h3>
  <img src="ArchaeologyAnthropology/weekends-in-the-soil.jfif" alt="weekends in the soil">
  <p>
    One of our long-time members, Dr. Edward J. Lenik, wrote a marvelous little
    book in 1977 that is a superb guide and resource for the amateur 
    historical archaeologist. Entitled Weekends in the Soil, it was
    originally published by the Archeological Society of New Jersey; and 
    although it is now out-of-print, Dr. Lenik holds the copyright and has 
    authorized NEARA to make it available as a PDF for download.

    You are highly encouraged to have a look at it, and I’m sure you will find 
    the material fascinating and helpful. Here is an excerpt to give you a 
    taste: “By now it should be evident that the archaeologist is something 
    more than just a ‘digger.’ His role is, in a very real sense, similar to
    that of a detective. Through careful excavation, observation, and 
    recording of the evidence in the ground, the archaeologist attempts to 
    reconstruct previous events. Much like Sherlock Holmes, the 
    archaeologist must use powers of observation and common sense along with
    the knowledge of history to find out what happened in the past.”
  </p>
  <p>
    As heritage preservation standards have strengthened over the past 40 
    years, many of the undertakings described in this book would not now be 
    done by an amateur without the supervision of a qualified archaeologist.
    NEARA and other organizations often do provide such supervised 
    opportunities for amateurs to participate, and being familiar with the 
    material in Dr. Lenik’s book will be a tremendous asset in that case. 
    Furthermore, most of the guidance can just as well be applied to the 
    researching and recording of sites without disturbing them, to which all
    of us can contribute our efforts.

    the hows and whys of snevironmental study, surveying and excavating 
    sites , with details about methodology of field photography, artifact 
    analysis and the collection of materials. Although published in 1980, it
