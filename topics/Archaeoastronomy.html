  <h2>Archaeoastronomy</h2>

    From time immemorial humans have looked 
    heavenward attempting to decipher the meaning of the steady yet changing
    course of the sun, the wandering stars and the slower moving twinkling 
    starry background of the night sky. We are learning more and more how 
    these movements were tracked and often echoed, coded and marked on the 
    earthly landscape.

    Here in the American west, the calendrical value of native “medicine wheels has long been recognized. Yet even after 19<sup>th</sup>
    century diffusionist scholars noted the resemblance of many New England
    stone ruins to counter parts in Europe, little thought was given to 
    indigenous ways of the charting the sky and marking time.
  </p>
  <p>
    That changed in New England with the publication of a definitive study titled
    <i>Manitou, the Sacred Landscape of New England’s Native Civilization</i>
    by Byron Dix and James Mavor where astronomy and archaeology merge. 
    Ever since, the subjecthas slowly gained acceptance by a larger and 
    increasingly academic audience.

  <h3>Archaeoastronomy</h3>
  <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
  <p>
    Archaeoastronomy is the study of how people in the past "have understood the phenomena 
    in the sky, how they used phenomena in the sky and what role the sky 
    played in their cultures."
    Clive Ruggles argues it is misleading to consider archaeoastronomy to 
    be the study of ancient astronomy, as modern astronomy is a scientific 
    discipline, while archaeoastronomy considers other cultures' 
    symbolically rich cultural interpretations of phenomena in the sky. It 
    is often twinned with ethnoastronomy, the 
    anthropological study of skywatching in contemporary societies. 
    Archaeoastronomy is also closely associated with historical astronomy, 
    the use of historical records of heavenly events to answer astronomical 
    problems and the history of astronomy, which uses written records to 
    evaluate past astronomical practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Archaeoastronomy uses a variety of 
    methods to uncover evidence of past practices including archaeology, 
    anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. 
    Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different 
    sources, the problem of integrating them into a coherent argument has 
    been a long-term issue for archaeoastronomers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Archaeoastronomy fills complementary 
    niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology. Material 
    evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape 
    can be integrated into beliefs about the cycles of nature, such as Mayan
    astronomy and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which 
    have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies 
    of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Archaeoastronomy can be applied to all
    cultures and all time periods. The meanings of the sky vary from 
    culture to culture; nevertheless there are scientific methods which can 
    be applied across cultures when examining ancient beliefs. It is perhaps
    the need to balance the social and scientific aspects of 
    archaeoastronomy which led Clive Ruggles to describe it as:
    "...[A] field with academic work of high quality at one end but uncontrolled
    speculation bordering on lunacy at the other."
