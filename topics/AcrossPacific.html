	<h2>Across the Pacific Migrations</h2>

    We have long wondered at the Polynesian sailing ability, but not until 
    Thor Heyerdahl's KonTiki voyage, did we accept that our human ancestors 
    could have made such a journal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Heyerdahl believed that pre-Columbian 
    people from South America could have settled Polynesia, although many 
    anthropologists believed that it was impossible. His aim in mounting the
    Kon Tiki expedition was to show, by using only the materials and 
    technologies available in the remote past, that there were no technical 
    reasons to prevent such travel and He ultimately proved that the raft 
    could make the journey.

  <p>
    Over the years other researchers have 
    pondered the migrations and appearence of materials, both manmade and 
    natural, which could never have survived an ocean drift of such a 
    distance.

  <h3>THE SUBVERSIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF TRANSPACIFIC CONTACT</h3>
  <p>by Betty J. Meggers</p>
  <p>
    When we suggested more than 40 years ago that pottery making was introduced 
    to the coast of Ecuador from the southernmost island of Japan around 
    6000 years ago, the reaction among U.S. archeologists was mixed 
    (Meggers, Evans, and Estrada 1965). A few thought the evidence was 
    convincing, but the majority did not. The latter argued that the 
    decorative techniques were simple and easy to invent; that suitable 
    watercraft did not exist and if they did, that the trip would have 
    required more than a year and no one could have survived; that anyone 
    who survived either would have been killed or absorbed without making 
    any impact; that vessels would have stopped in California rather than 
    continued to Ecuador; and, more recently, that to suggest Native 
    Americans did not invent pottery independently is an insult to their 
    intelligence. Interestingly, some opponents actually admit that if the 
    Valdivia (Ecuador) and Jomon (Japan) complexes were both encountered in 
    the Americas—no matter how widely separated—their relationship would not
    be doubted.

    now believe they did not. His aim in mounting the Kon-Tiki expedition 
    was to show, by using only the materials and technologies available to 
    those people at the time, that there were no technical reasons to 
    prevent them from having done so. Although the expedition carried some 
    modern equipment, such as a radio, watches, charts, sextant, and metal 
    knives, Heyerdahl argued they were incidental to the purpose of proving 
    that the raft itself could make the journey.
