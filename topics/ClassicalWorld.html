    Among the first to test the icy boreal 
    waters of the North Atlantic was the astronomer, Pytheas of Marseilles, 
    who ventured to Ultima Thule and witnessed the sea turning into “thick 
    gray sludge”. Roman merchants no doubt ventured into the North Atlantic,
    but only Tacitus left an account of Agricola’s men subduing the 
    Orkneys. Caesar commented on the construction and seaworthiness of 
    Gaelic ships.

    This paper reexamines one of the few trustworthy ar­chaeological findings that 
    supports the thesis of previous contacts between the Old and New Worlds.
    Today in the ceramics hall of the National Museum of Archaeology in 
    Mexico City is displayed a little terra cotta human head with apparently
    non-Amerindian features.

  <h3>ICELAND'S GEOGRAPHICAL HISTORY: CONCEPTS OF ICELAND ITS NATURAL HISTORY AND RESEARCH BEFORE AND AFTER SETTLEMENT</h3>
  <p>
    Thorvaldur Thoroddsen,
    PUBLISHED IN ICELANDIC BY THE LITERARY SOCIETY, REYKJAVIK, 1892
    TRANSLATION BY SUZANNE CARLSON
  </p>
  <p>
    While surfing Google digital books or works in Icelandic, I stumbled on
    this book on the geo­graphical history of Iceland. The title of the 
    first chapter intrigued me, "History of Iceland before Settlement, the 
    Account of Pytheas." The author, Thorvaldur Thoroddsen, was a late 
    nineteenth cen­tury geologist who presented a review of geography woven 
    seamlessly into the history of Iceland, begin­ning with an analysis of 
    the mystical island of Thule in the unknown reaches of the northern sea.
    I hope you enjoy this northern voyage to the mare congela­turn, which 
    throbs like a "sea lung."

  <p>CHAPTER I [EXCERPT]. HISTORY OF ICELAND BE­FORE SETTLEMENT: THE ACCOUNT OF PYTHEAS</p>
	<blockquote>
    Few thought it likely that any people could have in­habited Iceland before 
    the Irish in the eighth century, nor had they found man-made evidence or
    confirma­tion of earlier human contact. Throughout Europe and America, 
    evidence has been found of Neolithic people in earlier cultural levels. 
    Whether on islands or else­where, research certainly shows that savages 
    had lived in Northern Europe, Iceland had, no doubt, been severed from 
    the continent long before Northern Europe had been settled by human 
    clans during the Stone Age and long after. Using small boats poorly 
    suited for the open ocean, they were not able to endure heavy seas; they
    followed the coasts, and did not risk the open ocean. Later, even the 
    Phoenicians were lost if they could not see land, and dared not venture 
    far from the coast.
