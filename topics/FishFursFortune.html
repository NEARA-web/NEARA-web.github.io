  <h2>Fish, Furs, and Fortune</h2>
  <p>
    There continues to be 
    speculation that Northern Europeans continued sailing around the North 
    Atlantic rim throughout the medieval period. Fur, so necessary
    for cold climate clothing was scarcer and scarcer to find. Fishing 
    grounds, especially for the cod that fed an expanding population was 
    pushed farther and farther west into the Atlantic and the lure of great 
    wealth provided ample motivation for daring adventurers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Columbus’ “discovery “of a new world across
    the Atlantic set off a race throughout Europe to exploit the riches, 
    subdue the native populations and settle the vast uncharted continent. 
    The Portuguese, Corte Real in collaboration with the Danish crown 
    explored the north east coast of North America during the turn of the 
    century around 1500. The list has grown rapidly, Sebastian Cabot, a 
    contemporary of Corte Real, Basque, Breton and Norman fisherman were 
    scouring the North Atlantic banks for cod. By 1511 a “gentleman of the 
    Azores” established a soap factory somewhere along the maritime coast in
    1520. Then came Verrazano in 1524-27 with Jacques Cartier in1541, while
    fish stations were multiplying for process fish and whale oil in the 
    1530s. As the century wore on, the English and French competed to secure
    settlements and land grants throughout the future colonies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fourteen years before the Pilgrims landed 
    at Plymouth Rock, followers of George Popham began construction of a 
    permanent settlement on the Maine coast. By 1630 the slow trickle of 
    adventurers had emerged into the British and French Colonies of North 
    American and a new future.

  <p>THE SECOND ROUND OF DISCOVERY</p>
  <p>Suzanne Carlson</p>
  <p>
    The Old Viking routes were not exclusively for raiding and rapine.
    The anonymous author of the 13<sup>th</sup>
    century King’s Mirror, using the device of a father (the King) 
    instructing his son on the ways of the business, presents a reliable 
    text book on early medieval trade in northern realms. The power of the 
    king and his agents increased with their control of that trade. An 
    additional twist was added when the church demanded ever-greater 
    payments. Church records, even in far away Greenland mostly consist of 
    payment ledgers and inventories of church property (movable and fixed).
  </p>
  <p>
    The <i>Diplomatarium Norvegicum</i>(available
    on the Internet) includes a rich array of customs records and bills of 
    lading in addition to the endless church and royal decrees. In addition 
    to exotic Greenland fare, American timber, fur and fish galore were 
    finding their way to southern markets. The King grew rich, traders 
    prospered, the church expanded and the great monastic houses sent 
    brothers and sisters north to help build a new earthly order. Bishops 
    were dispatched further and further west.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beginning in the 12th century, Baltic merchants carried northern goods down the 
    great rivers of Europe to an ever- growing market. Gradually German 
    merchants established posts in nearly all northern ports and were knit 
    into the Hanseatic League, a merchants' union centered in Hamburg and 
    Lubeck. The hegemony created by the Germanic Hansa bit into the pockets 
    of both church and crown, to say nothing of ordinary traders, leading to
    endless quarrels, embargoes and retaliations for real or perceived 
    wrongs on both sides. Stockfish (cod) was often at the center of 
    sea-born actions. The age of the “Cod wars” was long and bitter and 
    particularly affected Iceland, and no doubt, reached toward Greenland. 
    It is hard to imagine that the North Cannibals do most inhabit between 
    Norumbega and Bariniah.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Atlantic bridge linking the North Sea cod fisherman to The Shetlands, 
    Faeroes, Iceland and Greenland did not extend to the fish-rich shallow 
    banks to the southwest. (Now the Grand and Georges Banks)
  </p>
  <p>
    Five years after Columbus crossed the Atlantic to find a more southerly 
    route to the Orient, Genoese cum Venetian, Giovanni Caboto, Commissioned
    by the King of England under the English moniker of John Cabot set sail
    to find the gold at the end of the Northwest Passage. After three 
    tries, no China and a cargo of fools' gold was his reward. His son 
    Sebastian, attempted to follow in his father's wake and made at least 
    one voyage to North America, looking for the hoped for Northwest Passage
    (1508), as well as another to repeat Magellan's voyage around the 
    world. Instead heended up looking for silver along the Río de la 
    Plata (1525-8).
  </p>
  <p>
    Rumors, no doubt lingered and rippled across northern Europe. Yet, the Italian 
    explorer, Giovanni da Verrazzano, in the service of the French crown, 
    was also renowned as one of the first Europeans since the Norse 
    expeditions to North America around AD 1000 to explore the Atlantic 
    coast of North America. He ventured from the Carolinas to Newfoundland 
    including New York harbor and Narragansett Bay in 1524.

    In 1534, Jacques Cartier set sail under a commission from the king of 
    France, hoping to discover a western passage to the wealth of Asia where
    he was to "discover certain islands and lands where it is said that a 
    great quantity of gold and other precious things are to be found". And 
    so after exploring parts of Newfoundland, the areas now the Canadian 
    Atlantic provinces and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, his name was added to 
    the "discovers of the New World".
  </p>
  <p>
    The earliest written mention of the wealth of the world to the west was of 
    the fabled city of Norumbega. During the frenzied age of exploration, 
    when English interests were vying for their chunk of the New World, was 
    recorded in an interview of David Ingram by Sir Francis Walsingham in 
    1582. Ingram was among crew members of the famous, or rather infamous 
    pirate-Privateer John Hawkes set ashore in the Gulf of Mexico in 1568 
    and over a course of a year made his way north, perhaps as far as Saint 
    John, New Brunswick, where he shipped back to England with Sir Humphrey 
    Gilbert in 1569 to tell his tale. His garbled report states that "The 
    people in those countries are professed enemies of the Cannibals or men 
    eaters.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next we hear of Simon Ferdinando, Considered by Hawkes of being a Spanish 
    spy and a "treacherous villin", but became Walsingham's man, who was 
    Elizabeth's secretary suggests that the highest interests of the court 
    were behind Ferdinando, who was incidentally Portuguese, not Spanish, 
    who in 1579 went in search of Norumbega. By 1580 John Walker who was 
    Humphrey Gilbert's man, tells of a silver mine 12 leagues from the mouth
    of what is certainly the Penobscot River.
