  <h2>Digging for Vestiges of Old Plymouth</h2>
  Peter Anick, July 2021
  <p>
    The town of Plymouth had been expecting a big tourist year in 2020 to commemorate its 400th
    anniversary. Needless to say, that didn’t happen. Instead it brought back memories of the “Great 
    Dying” that Native Americans experienced when European diseases ravaged the northeast coast 
    just prior to the arrival of the Pilgrims. The town of Plymouth had been planning to open a new 
    memorial on Cole’s Hill above Plymouth Rock to be called Remembrance Park in memory of both 
    the Wampanoag and Pilgrim losses four centuries ago. However, the delay gave archaeologists 
    one more chance in 2021 to probe the soil before the construction of the park.

  <p>
    The dig, led by David Landon of UMass-Boston’s Fiske Center for Archaeological Research, ran 
    for most of the month of June and was open to the public. I timed my visit for lunchtime since 
    most of the team would be on break. They had opened several excavation pits atop the steep hill 
    to seek out remains from 18th century houses that had once crowded the small area. One test pit 
    contained broken pieces of bricks and tableware and may have been a trash dump outside a kitchen 
    window. Another trench followed a string of stones believed to be part of a house foundation
    (Figure 1). An earlier excavation had also found traces of an Indian site here and they were hoping 
    to track down more of it with test pits. So far, a few shells and flakes had turned up, including a 
    piece of jasper from Pennsylvania (Figure 2).

    The team alerted me to a second dig in the works just a little farther uphill. The graveyard on Burial 
    Hill is the highest point in the area, offering a commanding view of the surroundings. It had been 
    thought that the earliest fort constructed by the settlers would have been somewhere on this hill. 
    Over several seasons, the UMass field school had dug trenches in an area just below the eastern 
    extent of the cemetery (Figure 3). Here they noted a curious distinction in the distribution of 
    artifacts: Wampanoag lithic and ceramic artifacts to the north and colonial remains to the south. In 
    2019, they located a line of discolored circles in the soil, evidence of a wooden palisade. This was 
    likely the northern wall of the Plymouth Colony’s first fort in 1621. Indians would have camped 
    outside for trade while settlers’ houses would have been built up along the inside of the wall. The 
    team may be back again next year, so follow their progress on facebook at 
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FiskeCenter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fiske Center</a>
    and consider a visit next summer.

      trench is on the southern side of the 1621 palisade, within the confines of the old fort. The mix of 
      Indian and European ceramics in the Colony’s trash suggests a closer relationship between 
      settlers and Indians than previously thought. The first “Thanksgiving” likely took place near 
      here.</figcaption>
