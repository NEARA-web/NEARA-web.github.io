    Eastern Connecticut is the 
    historic home of the Pequots (Mohegans), who migrated there from the 
    Hudson River Valley shortly before the arrival of Europeans. 
    Mohegan legends are full of stories of the Little People, good spirits 
    who must be treated with respect. Some of the many small chambers 
    and stone niches that dot the countryside may be the homes of the Little
    People. Moshup the giant also left his mark in the many stones 
    strewn about the state. Lantern Hill, a shining quartz 
    outcropping, also had special meaning to the Indians and is known to 
    have served as a lookout for the Pequot chief Saccacus.

  <h3>Montville Souterrain</h3>

  <p>
    This narrow, slab roofed chamber extends over thirty feet into a hillside. 
    With an entrance only 22 inches square, much of its length requires 
    crawling on hands and knees. Mavor and Dix considered both 
    European and Native American origins. Finding no solar or lunar 
    alignments, they suggest that its termination in the bedrock might 
    indicate a Native American structure designed to “connect people with 
    the Earth manitou (spirit).

  <h3>Gungywamp</h3>

  <p>
    The Gungywamp complex is an odd collection of stone features running the 
    gamut from prehistoric rock shelter to post-colonial fireplace. How the 
    small “beehive” chambers, a row of flat standing stones and a possible 
    grinding site composed of concentric stone rings fit it to the time 
    sequence, however, is anyone’s guess. Some have cited indentations in a 
    boulder resembling the Christian “chi rho” symbols and equinox light 
    effects through a chamber window as evidence for a Celtic connection, 
    but these features could also be natural or accidental.

  <h3>Pike-Marshall Preserve</h3>

  <p>
    A number of propped boulders, many resembling animal forms, have led to 
    speculation that there was more than glacial action involved in placing 
    these boulders where they currently lie.
  </p>

  <h3>Pulpit Rock, Groton</h3>
  <img src="Connecticut/pa_ct_pulpit_rock_groton.png" alt="pa ct pulpit rock groton" width="150" height="114">
  <p>
    Pulpit rock sits on the highest knoll in the area. Its name suggests its use by
    the early Christian settlers but it may well have been a sacred site 
    long before they arrived. Unfortunately, graffiti mars its 
    appearance today. There is a “weathering hole” on the right side 
    of the front of the stone.
