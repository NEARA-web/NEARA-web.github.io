  <p>
    Maine's prehistory was 
    formed by the retreat of the glacier about 12,000 years ago, inundating 
    the coastline and extending far into the interior. By 5,000 BP the 
    people known as the Maritime Archaic or Red Paint People were utilizing 
    the rich resources and burying their dead ceremoniously painted with red
    ocher, hence the name.
  </p>
  <p>
    The many subsequent Native groups left a
    culture inherited by living native tribes, the Penobscot, the 
    Passmaquoddy and the Micmac. Maine's unique geography with 3500 miles of
    deeply indented coastline and islands, the small amount of fertile land
    mostly along the rivers, the high mountains and generally rocky soil, 
    has affected the settlement patterns.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the time George Popham
    attempted his ill fated settlement in 1607 near the mouth of the 
    Kennebec River, there had been many other poorly documented voyages. 
    Arrival of the first Europeans resulted in disastrous epidemics that 
    wiped out a large percentage of the population.
  </p>
  <p>
    The 70+ Maine 
    Site Reports contain many that were first reported by the Early Sites 
    Research Society (ESRS) Jim Whittall, Malcolm Pearson, Mystery Hill, 
    Mead Stapler and others. Most have been updated, copied and reside in 
    the archives of the NEARA library in Nashua NH.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we explore the
    landscape we find it filled with many typical New England stone walls 
    (and many stone rows that do not fall in that category), a few stone 
    chambers, a surprising variety of well built cairns, and some 
    inexplicable stone constructions.
  </p>

  <h3>Spirit Pond</h3>

  <p>
    Without doubt the best known and 
    most controversial discovery of Pre-Columbian European presence in Maine
    was made in 1972 by a quintessential Maine Yankee named Walter Elliott.

  </p>
  <p>
    He spotted three mysterious stones at the edge of Spirit Pond, in 
    Phippsburg, Maine. About six by eleven inches, one stone clearly 
    featured a rough map and all with strange writing placed randomly on one
    side, and a few marked and crude drawings on the other. The second 
    stone bore a dozen letters on one side, and the third contained a long 
    message of sixteen lines neatly inscribed on both sides of the stone
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    Walter Elliott took the stones to the Bath Maritime Museum, where director 
    Harold Brown suggested that the marks might be in the Norse runic 
    alphabet. Subsequently the stones found their way to Einar Haugen, 
    Distinguished Harvard professor of Scandinavian languages and history. 
    In his published evaluation, he was adamant in crying fraud, hoax, 
    modern artifact, “a few Norse words in a sea of gibberish”. The 
    rank and file of Scholars stood behind the Haugen pronouncement.

  <h3>Belmont Chamber</h3>
  <h4>Solstice alignment at the Belmont Chamber</h4>
  <img src="Maine/belmont-chamber2.jfif" alt="belmont-chamber2" width="400" height="300">
  <p>
    Following up on Doug Schwartz’ 1995 work at the Belmont Maine Chamber, Ros 
    Strong and Sue Carlson decided it was time to revisit the question of 
    its astronomical alignments. Doug’s prediction that during the lunar 
    minor standstill the full moon’s glow would light the rear wall of the 
    chamber on the winter solstice was validated by the owner that December.
    The minor lunar standstill was really the next year, 1996-7, but 1995-6
    was very close. Doug had also suggested that something might happen 
    during the summer solstice sunset.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sue, an enthusiastic user of Google’s 
    Sketchup for 3D architectural computer modeling, constructed the 
    primitive “Virtual” chamber shown above, right. To do this she set the 
    longitude, latitude, solstice date and declination based on GPS and 
    corrected compass readings. After setting “show shadows”, she scrolled 
    through the sunset hour watching the sunbeam travel across the 
    floor of the chamber and evaporates at the back corner of 
    the southeast wall.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the evening of June 21, a NEARA group
    and the owners gathered at the chamber around 6:45, clutching cameras 
    while trying to wish away the low clouds visible through the trees on 
    the horizon. Slowly the show began in accordance with the virtual 
    test. The photo (above left) shows a small faint rectangle beginning its
    creep up the back wall. As the shaft of light moved across the 
    chamber wall, the clouds dimmed its glow. But at the moment the full orb
    was visible by an observer – and camera – from the inside corner. For 
    us, especially those who have never observed this sort of astronomical 
    event, it was truly “awesome.”

    We know there are other chambers that track solar-lunar astronomical 
    events in the Northeast. Byron Dix and Jim Mavor studied Massachusetts’ 
    Upton Chamber and Vermont’s Calendar I in depth. Other sites such as the
    Burnt Hill Standing stones in Massachusetts and the Bingham Cairns in 
    Maine have been verified. Others have been rumored or reported.

  <h3>Whitefield Cairns</h3>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    Historical research on the N. Whitefield cairns continues with the help of Jay 
    Robbins; still no clue as to any reason for this huge construction. 
    Clayton McLaughlin of Fairfield and Rob Sirois of Gorham have been out 
    in rugged areas taking GPS readings on some old sites and new ones such 
    as Beech Hill. We are particularly interested in adding this new 
    information to current topo maps as part of a professional looking site report.

    extends, led the first English expedition to the region now covered by 
    the State of Maine, but then known as a part of Norombega.
