  <p>
    Rhode Island may be a small 
    state but it is rich in lithic features. Clusters of rockpiles are 
    spread throughout its conservation lands, petroglyphs and runes are 
    carved along its shores, and curiously propped boulders suggest that 
    more than nature was involved in the manipulation of the stone-filled 
    landscape.

  <h3>Newport Tower</h3>
  <img src="RhodeIsland/pa_ri_newport_tower_2.webp" alt="pa ri newport tower 2">
  <p>
    The unusual arched architecture of the tower gracing Touro Park in Newport 
    has spawned considerable speculation on its origin and use. Historically
    known as the remains of a 17<sup>th</sup> century windmill constructed 
    by Governor Benedict Arnold, alternative proposals have conjured up 
    visits by Vikings, Medieval Norse, Portuguese, Templars, the Chinese and
    Basques. A nearby museum makes the case for a link to the Elizabethan 
    navigator and astronomer John Dee.

    Tom Elmore produced a video about NEARA's project to make a 3D LiDAR scan of Newport Tower:

    Tom writes: "This video shows the first ever 3D LiDAR scan of the Newport Tower.
    Our scanner captures 300,000 points per second while we walk, and in this case while we
    lifted it up and back down inside the Tower in a non-invasive manner.
    The scans were registered together to include Touro Park and then georeferenced to
    6 GPS points scattered around the Park."

  <h3>Narragansett Stone</h3>

  <p>
    Long visible at low tide on the west side of Narragansett Bay, this boulder 
    contained engraved characters resembling Norse runes. Although difficult
    to date or authenticate, some accept the stone’s engravings as evidence
    for pre-Columbian Viking exploration of Rhode Island’s shoreline.
  </p>
    
  <h3>Rockpiles</h3>

  <img src="RhodeIsland/pa_ri_queens_cairns_2.webp" alt="pa ri queens cairns 2">
  <p>
    Clusters of stone piles can be found within the state’s conservation lands. Some
    may be remnants of Indian burial or prayer sites while others may be 
    the result of field clearing. Perhaps analysis of the distribution of 
    piles and research into historic land use may one day tease these 
    theories apart.
  </p>
    
  <h3>Eschoheag Propped Boulders</h3>

  <img src="RhodeIsland/pa_ri_escoheag_boulder_2a.webp" alt="pa ri escoheag boulder 2a">
  <p>
    Glaciers may have left these large erratics perched in prominent locations, or 
    perhaps they were jockeyed into position by prehistoric peoples. Either 
    way, the pair of propped boulders peering from bedrock outcrops in 
    Eschoheag create an impressive image.

  <h3>Symbol Rock, Yawgoog</h3>
  <img src="RhodeIsland/ri_yawgoog_symbol_rock.webp" alt="ri yawgoog symbol rock">
  <p>
    Deep furrows in a boulder on the Scout Reservation have been interpreted by 
    some as Native American symbols, perhaps a tomahawk and arrowhead 
    signifying a hidden cache of weapons nearby. But like so many of 
    the other lithic features in Rhode Island, there are other possible 
    explanations, from a pioneer engraving to natural erosion of softer 
    veins in the stone.

  <h3>Manitou Hassannash Preserve</h2>

  <p>
    The Manitou Hassannash Preserve (MHP) in Hopkinton RI preserves over 1000 stone structures
    in 14 acres of rocky hillside.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mary Gage has shared a video about the diversity of stone cairns found at MHP:

    NEARA had a webinar on using relatively new technologies together for recording, preserving, and exploring sites,
    including 3D LiDAR scanning at MHP.  You can watch the recorded session at:

  <h3>Tiverton Petroglyphs</h3>
  <p>
    3D models of the somewhat worn petroglyphs on a beach in Tiverton are available
    for interactive viewing at <a href="RhodeIsland/TivertonPetroglyphs.html">Tiverton Petroglyphs</a>.
