  <h3>NEARA at Lehigh Valley events</h3>
  <p>
    By Jim Wilson
  </p>
  <p>
    NEARA helped sponsor four community events in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley in mid-March: at the
    <a href="https://watershedcoalitionlv.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Indigenous-Perspectives-NNC.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lehigh Valley Watershed Conference</a> in Bethlehem PA, and the 
    <a href="https://watershedcoalitionlv.org/lehigh-valley-watershed-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature Nurture Center</a> in Easton PA.
    In addition to NEARA's $1500 sponsorship, NEARA volunteers from PA, NJ, CT and RI helped plan and deliver these public programs
    and engaged with the many folks who stopped by NEARA's sponsorship table at each of the two venues where the four events were held on March 11-14.
    In total, about 300 people attended these four events and had access to NEARA's sponsorship table at all of them.
    Dozens of email addresses were collected and lots of NEARA literature were freely taken, including our spring conference registration materials.
  </p>
  <p>
    NEARA's sponsorship helped pay expenses for speakers to attend the events and address constructed cultural landscapes,
    the use of archaeology for land conservation with Indigenous tribes, and present a film screening and roundtable discussion about the award winning documentary,
    <i>"The Water Gap: Return to the Homeland"</i>.
    The film screening and roundtable was led by the Choctaw filmmaker and three young Delaware women, who were teenagers when the film was made in 2016.

    Jim Wilson presented two illustrated programs on constructed stone landscapes during these events,
    which were sponsored as in-kind contributions by Jim's employer, Northampton County Parks and Recreation.

  <h3>Documenting Constructed Stone Landscapes in Eastern Pennsylvania</h3>

    Jim Wilson contributed an article to the Pennsylvania SHPO's annual report on archaeological site reporting activities.
    The article starts on page 14.  Other interesting articles are in the document, too.

  <h3>Jim Wilson on Constructed Stone Landscapes in Pennsylvania</h3>
  <p>
    Jim Wilson made a great presentation to the Watershed Coalition of the Lehigh Valley.  You can view it on Facebook at:
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/146334712442984/videos/2834092913546251" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Mysteries of Constructed Stone Landscapes</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jim Wilson adds: "I would like to correct an error in my presentation.
    It was local avocational archeologist Ed Henning who was the champion of,
    and deserves the credit for the recording of the Pocono Creek Watershed CSL in Monroe County with the PA State Historic Preservation Office.
    I mistakenly cited Ed Lenik in my talk. My apologies to Mr. Henning for that misattribution."
