  <h3>The Sandyston Stone Chamber In New Jersey</h3>
  <p>By Larry Mulligan</p>
  <p>From NEARA Newsletter 1972, by Ed Lenik:</p>
  <p>
    This underground chamber was formed by a natural crevice in the bedrock. The
    roof was made by capping the crevice with 13 large flat stones. Earth 
    and brush now cover the roof.

    In 1966, my aquaintance Mr. Milton Monks reported that the back of the chamber opened up into a "large room".
    He had visited the site "15 years ago". However, our examination showed that the rear of the chamber
    terminated in bedrock with no "large room" present.
  </p>
  <p>
    About 30 feet to the north of this underground
    chamber is a small rockshelter and a possible second underground 
    chamber. the roof of this second chamber has collapsed. perhaps this 
    possible 2nd underground chamber mightr contain a "large room" as 
    reported by Mr. Monks.

    The famous Indian site known as the Bevans Rockshelter is approximately 100
    yds. south of the underground chamber. This rockshelter is at the 
    bottom of the bedrock ledge and borders a present day swamp. The Bevans 
    Rockshelter was excavated approximately 30 years ago by Dr. Dorothy Cross of the New Jersey State Museum.

    A large area in front of the entrance to the chamber has been filled with
    domestic trash. This trash is approximately 2 to 3 feet deep and 
    consists of coal, coal ashes , glass and pottery fragments. An 
    examination of the surface material indicates a 19th century date for the dump.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to Mr. Monks, the interior of the underground chamber has been dug several 
    times by Indian relic collectors. Further exploration should be done on 
    the roof of the chamber, hopefully to get some charcoal for a carbon 
    date. The area in front of the chamber should also be excavated in order to
    accurately date the period of trash dumping, and farm occupation nearby.
