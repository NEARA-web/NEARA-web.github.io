  <h2>New Hampshire Chapter</h2>
  <p>
    <i>Contact the coordinator at</i> <a href="mailto:NH-coord@neara.org">NH-coord@neara.org</a>
  </p>

<p>
  The New Hampshire Chapter is 
  where NEARA began. Back in 1964 a group of like-minded antiquarians came
  together to share a passion for the enigmatic lithic structures they 
  were finding in the New Hampshire woods. NEARA was born! Not 
  too much later, the first woman joined their group, as did interested 
  parties from the other New England states. New Hampshire is still a hub 
  of activity for the NEARA, although members now join from world wide 
  locations. After all New Hampshire is home to Mystery Hill
  (<a href="https://www.stonehengeusa.com/" target="_blank">America's Stonehenge</a>),
  the Madison boulder, and the mailing of the Transit and Journals.
</p>
<p>
  Please join the current day 
  NEARA researchers as they tromp over hill and dale in search of 
  that odd stone formation and verify that it is truly engimatic 
  when they do deed research and find no recorded deeds!
</p>

<h2>Chambers</h2>
<img src="NewHampshire/Acworth_chamber.PNG" alt="Acworth chamber">
<p>
  Chambers, small stone buildings of indefinite function, dot the hilltops and roadsides of New 
  Hampshire. Some believe they are the remains
  of colonial root cellars. Others argue that they are Native American 
  ceremonial structures or Celtic in origin. Some New Hampshire chambers 
  are listed below.
</p>

<h3>Acworth Chambers</h3>
<p>
  Located on a hilltop in
  Acworth are many small enclosures and stone rows that have excited the 
  curiosity of people for the last century. William Goodwin’s 1947 book History of Great Ireland in New England
  compared the site in Acworth to similar sites in Europe and 
  hypothesized that the chambers and stone rows were built by Irish monks 
  settling the northeast centuries before the arrival of Columbus. Later 
  ideas claim different functions for the site, including Native American 
  ceremonial structures, colonial storage chambers, and the remains of fox
  hunting traps.
</p>

<h3>The Danville Chamber</h3>
<img src="NewHampshire/Danville_Chamber.PNG" alt="Danville Chamber">
<p>
  The Danville Chamber is
  relatively easy to find and is, at this time, accessible to the public.
  Follow Route 111A to Hersey Road. Hersey Road bears sharply to the 
  left. Follow it to the end and park out of the way of the DPW facility 
  access. Walk down the dirt road and look for a trail to the left; follow
  the trail along the bedrock outcrop and look for the chamber built into
  the side of the hill.
</p>

<h3>Derry Chamber</h3>
<img src="NewHampshire/Derry_chamber.PNG" alt="Derry chamber">
<p>
  The Derry chamber is 
  located along an abandoned railroad track in Derry and most likely of 
  modern construction. Look for drill marks along the rocks at the bottom 
  of the interior of the chamber.
</p>
<p>
  To get to the Derry 
  chamber follow Windham Road in Windham to Windham Depot Rd. Turn onto 
  Windham Depot Rd and look for rail trail parking immediately on your 
  right. Once out of your car follow the paved area to the rail trail 
  head. DO NOT follow the main trail, but look for an unpaved side trail 
  off to the left. Follow this trail for 0.2 miles. The chamber will be 
  immediately off the trail to the left.
</p>

<h2>Natural Features</h2>
<p>
  Most of New Hampshire’s 
  unusual rock formations are known to be natural; some argue that these 
  formations are the work of early man. Glaciers have rearranged these 
  heavy stones so that they appear in almost impossible-to-believe 
  formations. Man, however, may have also enhanced the work of nature.
</p>

<h3>Perched Boulders</h3>
<a href="https://www.franklinsites.com/hikephotos/NewHampshire/raggedmtn-2012-0312.php" target="_blank"></a>
<p>
  Perched boulders, also 
  known as balanced rocks, are places of natural beauty that capture the 
  imagination of many today and may have been significant to New 
  Hampshire’ first inhabitants. Perched boulders in New Hampshire may be 
  found in Andover,

<h3>Rocking Stones</h3>
<img src="NewHampshire/Rocking_stone_Andover_nh.jfif">
<p>
  Early accounts of New Hampshire include many descriptions of “rocking stones”,
  boulders that move easily on their base when pushed or disturbed by the wind.
  The most famous of these, the Durham rocking stone, is described below:
</p>
<p>
  “A large detached block of granite, in the south-east part of this town, 
  was formerly placed in a very singular situation. Its weight was sixty 
  or seventy tons, and it was poised so exactly upon two other stones, as 
  to be visibly moved by the wind. It was some years since dislodged from 
  this extraordinary position by the barbarous curiosity of some 
  visitors.”
  Hayward, John. A Gazetteer of New Hampshire Containing Descriptions of All the Counties, Towns, and Districts in the State. John P. Jewett: Boston, 1849.
</p>
<p>
  Other rocking stones have been described in historical records in Andover, Goffstown, Hanover, Meredith, Newport, and Warren.
</p>

<h3>Native American Rock Sites</h3>
<img src="NewHampshire/Jefferson_petroglyph.png" alt="Jefferson petroglyph">
<p>
  Most early historical 
  accounts attempted to write the Native peoples of New Hampshire out of 
  its history sometime in the Eighteenth century. Reduced by disease, 
  driven away from their homelands and into Canada, or forced to 
  assimilate, the Native population of New Hampshire seemed to disappear. 
  Under these circumstances it became easy for many to claim that New 
  Hampshire was never home to any substantial Indian population, a view 
  that still exists in many parts of the state today.
</p>
<p>
  If one looks closely, 
  though, reminders of this vibrant and substantial culture can still be 
  seen in woods and backyards throughout the state. Petroglyphs, grinding 
  stones, and other stone remains are still being found and 
  recorded. NEARA is attempting to do its part to preserve and
  document the remains of this once omnipresent Native New 
  Hampshire below.
</p>

<h3>Petroglyphs</h3>
<img src="NewHampshire/Franklin_petro_copy.PNG" alt="Franklin petro copy">
<p>
  Pictures in 
  stone are often hiding in plainsight. Look closely at large 
  boulders or rockslocated in significant places and you may see one
  jump out from the shadows of the rock.
</p>

<h3>Cupules</h3>
<img src="NewHampshire/Laconia_cupules.PNG" alt="Laconia cupules">
<p>
  Cupules, circular 
  indentations pecked or ground into bedrock or boulders, have long been 
  associated with Native cultures of North America, and are found in 
  several locations across the northeast, including New Hampshire. One of 
  these sites is in Laconia at Endicott Rock Park.
</p>
<p>
  The original charters 
  of Massachusetts and New Hampshire stated that the border between these 
  colonies was to be set three miles north of the Merrimack River. 
  However, subsequent reports indicated that the Merrimack River ran 
  north-south, not east-west, as first believed, and a border dispute 
  between the states soon ensued.
</p>
<p>
  In 1652 Governor 
  Endicott pressed his advantage and sent members of the Massachusetts Bay
  Colony in search of the source of the Merrimack River. With the help of
  their Indian guides, these men made it to Weirs Beach, or Aquedocton, 
  in Laconia, the site of a large Indian settlement, and carved their 
  initials and the name of Governor Endicott upon a large rock in the 
  channel of the Winnipesaukee River, laying claim to the surrounding land
  for Massachusetts.
</p>
<p>
  Long thought of as a 
  significant historic place, Endicott Rock has recently been reevaluated 
  to include the cupules that mark its surface. These cupules, located on a
  prominent rock near a large fishing village, must have been significant
  to the Native community of Aquedocton and the guides who led the 
  colonists to the source of the Merrimack River.
</p>

<h3>Grinding Stones</h3>
<img src="NewHampshire/Franklin_grinding_stone.PNG" alt="Franklin grinding stone">
<p>
  Grinding stones are believed to have 
  been used by Native peoples to grind their corn.  This one is located
  in Franklin at the corner or Dearborn and Central Streets.
</p>

<h3>Runes</h3>
<p>Thorvald’s Rock, Hampton, NH</p>
<p>
  Across the street from 
  the Tuck Museum in Hampton is a boulder covered with lines and scratches
  once thought to be a runic inscription marking the site of the burial 
  of Thorvald, an early Viking explorer of “Vinland”. Encased in a 
  concrete enclosure and set beneath iron bars, this rock was once so 
  important to the residents of this town that it sparked the formation of
  the local historical society. Now debunked and widely thought of as a 
  fake, Thorvald’s rock still attracts visitors to the Tuck Museum.
</p>
<p>
  Hampton’s Lane Memorial Library is a great source for more stories on
  <a href="https://www.hampton.lib.nh.us/hampton/history/thorvald.htm" target="_blank">Thorvald’s Rock</a>.
</p>

<h3>Rock Piles</h3>
<img src="NewHampshire/Northwood_rock_pile.PNG" alt="Northwood rock pile">
<img src="NewHampshire/Bear_Brook_rock_pile_2.PNG" alt="Bear Brook State Park rock pile">
<p>
  New Hampshire is the “granite state” and one is not surprised to come across stone piles
  while walking in the woods. Some are clearly the remains of long-abandoned farms. 
  Others, located on land that no one would ever farm or built with 
  obvious design, seem more mysterious. Are they clearing piles left 
  behind on long-abandoned farms? Are they burial sites for early 
  colonists? Or are these the remains of Native American ceremonial sites?
</p>
<p>
  Our goal in NEARA is to
  document and preserve as many of these sites as possible until such 
  time as we can determine their origins and functions. Please help us 
  preserve them by reporting them to NEARA and by leaving them intact.

<h3>Stone Sites in New Hampshire</h3>

<p>NEARA
  cannot give out addresses to many of the private sites in our archives,
  but here are some links to sites open to the public in New Hampshire 
  that you may enjoy:
</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stonehengeusa.com" target="_blank">America’s Stonehenge</a>:</p>
<p>Who built this unusual site? Take a tour and decide for yourself.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endicott_Rock" target="_blank">Endicott Rock State Park:</a> </p>
<p>
  Covered in Native American cupules and initialed by colonial explorers,
  the smallest of New Hampshire’s state parks figures prominently in the border
  battle between New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
</p>

<p><a href="https://mikenh.wordpress.com/2009/10/22/marker-129-indian-mortar-lot/" target="_blank">Indian Mortar Lot Franklin, NH: </a></p>
<p>
  Located on the corner of Dearbon and Central Streets in Franklin, NH this small
  park contains an Indian mortar stone used by Native peoples to grind 
  their corn in past centuries. Also look for the fish petroglyph on 
  another boulder in the park.
</p>

<p><a href="https://des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/pip/publications/geologic/documents/madison-boulder-brochure.pdf" target="_blank">Madison Boulder</a>:</p>
