  <h2>New Hampshire Chapter</h2>
  <p>
    <i>Contact the coordinator at</i> <a href="mailto:NH-coord@neara.org">NH-coord@neara.org</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    The New Hampshire Chapter is 
    where NEARA began. Back in 1964 a group of like-minded antiquarians came
    together to share a passion for the enigmatic lithic structures they 
    were finding in the New Hampshire woods. NEARA was born! Not 
    too much later, the first woman joined their group, as did interested 
    parties from the other New England states. New Hampshire is still a hub 
    of activity for the NEARA, although members now join from world wide 
    locations. After all New Hampshire is home to Mystery Hill
    (<a href="https://www.stonehengeusa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America's Stonehenge</a>),
    the Madison boulder, and the mailing of the Transit and Journals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please join the current day 
    NEARA researchers as they tromp over hill and dale in search of 
    that odd stone formation and verify that it is truly engimatic 
    when they do deed research and find no recorded deeds!
  </p>

  <h2>Chambers</h2>
  <img src="NewHampshire/Acworth_chamber.webp" alt="Acworth chamber">
  <p>
    Chambers, small stone buildings of indefinite function, dot the hilltops and roadsides of New 
    Hampshire. Some believe they are the remains
    of colonial root cellars. Others argue that they are Native American 
    ceremonial structures or Celtic in origin. Some New Hampshire chambers 
    are listed below.
  </p>

  <h3>Acworth Chambers</h3>
  <p>
    Located on a hilltop in
    Acworth are many small enclosures and stone rows that have excited the 
    curiosity of people for the last century. William Goodwin’s 1947 book History of Great Ireland in New England
    compared the site in Acworth to similar sites in Europe and 
    hypothesized that the chambers and stone rows were built by Irish monks 
    settling the northeast centuries before the arrival of Columbus. Later 
    ideas claim different functions for the site, including Native American 
    ceremonial structures, colonial storage chambers, and the remains of fox
    hunting traps.
  </p>

  <h3>The Danville Chamber</h3>
  <img src="NewHampshire/Danville_Chamber.webp" alt="Danville Chamber">
  <p>
    The Danville Chamber is
    relatively easy to find and is, at this time, accessible to the public.
    Follow Route 111A to Hersey Road. Hersey Road bears sharply to the 
    left. Follow it to the end and park out of the way of the DPW facility 
    access. Walk down the dirt road and look for a trail to the left; follow
    the trail along the bedrock outcrop and look for the chamber built into
    the side of the hill.
  </p>

  <h3>Derry Chamber</h3>
  <img src="NewHampshire/Derry_chamber.webp" alt="Derry chamber">
  <p>
    The Derry chamber is 
    located along an abandoned railroad track in Derry and most likely of 
    modern construction. Look for drill marks along the rocks at the bottom 
    of the interior of the chamber.
  </p>
  <p>
    To get to the Derry 
    chamber follow Windham Road in Windham to Windham Depot Rd. Turn onto 
    Windham Depot Rd and look for rail trail parking immediately on your 
    right. Once out of your car follow the paved area to the rail trail 
    head. DO NOT follow the main trail, but look for an unpaved side trail 
    off to the left. Follow this trail for 0.2 miles. The chamber will be 
    immediately off the trail to the left.
  </p>

  <h2>Natural Features</h2>
  <p>
    Most of New Hampshire’s 
    unusual rock formations are known to be natural; some argue that these 
    formations are the work of early man. Glaciers have rearranged these 
    heavy stones so that they appear in almost impossible-to-believe 
    formations. Man, however, may have also enhanced the work of nature.
  </p>

  <h3>Perched Boulders</h3>
  <a href="https://www.franklinsites.com/hikephotos/NewHampshire/raggedmtn-2012-0312.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>
  <p>
    Perched boulders, also 
    known as balanced rocks, are places of natural beauty that capture the 
    imagination of many today and may have been significant to New 
    Hampshire’ first inhabitants. Perched boulders in New Hampshire may be 
    found in Andover,

  <h3>Rocking Stones</h3>
  <img src="NewHampshire/Rocking_stone_Andover_nh.jfif">
  <p>
    Early accounts of New Hampshire include many descriptions of “rocking stones”,
    boulders that move easily on their base when pushed or disturbed by the wind.
    The most famous of these, the Durham rocking stone, is described below:
  </p>
  <p>
    “A large detached block of granite, in the south-east part of this town, 
    was formerly placed in a very singular situation. Its weight was sixty 
    or seventy tons, and it was poised so exactly upon two other stones, as 
    to be visibly moved by the wind. It was some years since dislodged from 
    this extraordinary position by the barbarous curiosity of some 
    visitors.”
    Hayward, John. A Gazetteer of New Hampshire Containing Descriptions of All the Counties, Towns, and Districts in the State. John P. Jewett: Boston, 1849.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other rocking stones have been described in historical records in Andover, Goffstown, Hanover, Meredith, Newport, and Warren.
  </p>

  <h3>Native American Rock Sites</h3>
  <img src="NewHampshire/Jefferson_petroglyph.webp" alt="Jefferson petroglyph">
  <p>
    Most early historical 
    accounts attempted to write the Native peoples of New Hampshire out of 
    its history sometime in the Eighteenth century. Reduced by disease, 
    driven away from their homelands and into Canada, or forced to 
    assimilate, the Native population of New Hampshire seemed to disappear. 
    Under these circumstances it became easy for many to claim that New 
    Hampshire was never home to any substantial Indian population, a view 
    that still exists in many parts of the state today.
  </p>
  <p>
    If one looks closely, 
    though, reminders of this vibrant and substantial culture can still be 
    seen in woods and backyards throughout the state. Petroglyphs, grinding 
    stones, and other stone remains are still being found and 
    recorded. NEARA is attempting to do its part to preserve and
    document the remains of this once omnipresent Native New 
    Hampshire below.
  </p>

  <h3>Petroglyphs</h3>
  <img src="NewHampshire/Franklin_petro_copy.webp" alt="Franklin petro copy">
  <p>
    Pictures in 
    stone are often hiding in plainsight. Look closely at large 
    boulders or rockslocated in significant places and you may see one
    jump out from the shadows of the rock.
  </p>

  <h3>Cupules</h3>
  <img src="NewHampshire/Laconia_cupules.webp" alt="Laconia cupules">
  <p>
    Cupules, circular 
    indentations pecked or ground into bedrock or boulders, have long been 
    associated with Native cultures of North America, and are found in 
    several locations across the northeast, including New Hampshire. One of 
    these sites is in Laconia at Endicott Rock Park.
  </p>
  <p>
    The original charters 
    of Massachusetts and New Hampshire stated that the border between these 
    colonies was to be set three miles north of the Merrimack River. 
    However, subsequent reports indicated that the Merrimack River ran 
    north-south, not east-west, as first believed, and a border dispute 
    between the states soon ensued.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1652 Governor 
    Endicott pressed his advantage and sent members of the Massachusetts Bay
    Colony in search of the source of the Merrimack River. With the help of
    their Indian guides, these men made it to Weirs Beach, or Aquedocton, 
    in Laconia, the site of a large Indian settlement, and carved their 
    initials and the name of Governor Endicott upon a large rock in the 
    channel of the Winnipesaukee River, laying claim to the surrounding land
    for Massachusetts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Long thought of as a 
    significant historic place, Endicott Rock has recently been reevaluated 
    to include the cupules that mark its surface. These cupules, located on a
    prominent rock near a large fishing village, must have been significant
    to the Native community of Aquedocton and the guides who led the 
    colonists to the source of the Merrimack River.
  </p>

  <h3>Grinding Stones</h3>
  <img src="NewHampshire/Franklin_grinding_stone.webp" alt="Franklin grinding stone">
  <p>
    Grinding stones are believed to have 
    been used by Native peoples to grind their corn.  This one is located
    in Franklin at the corner or Dearborn and Central Streets.
  </p>

  <h3>Runes</h3>
  <p>Thorvald’s Rock, Hampton, NH</p>
  <p>
    Across the street from 
    the Tuck Museum in Hampton is a boulder covered with lines and scratches
    once thought to be a runic inscription marking the site of the burial 
    of Thorvald, an early Viking explorer of “Vinland”. Encased in a 
    concrete enclosure and set beneath iron bars, this rock was once so 
    important to the residents of this town that it sparked the formation of
    the local historical society. Now debunked and widely thought of as a 
    fake, Thorvald’s rock still attracts visitors to the Tuck Museum.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hampton’s Lane Memorial Library is a great source for more stories on
    <a href="https://www.hampton.lib.nh.us/hampton/history/thorvald.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thorvald’s Rock</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Rock Piles</h3>
  <img src="NewHampshire/Northwood_rock_pile.webp" alt="Northwood rock pile">
  <img src="NewHampshire/Bear_Brook_rock_pile_2.webp" alt="Bear Brook State Park rock pile">
  <p>
    New Hampshire is the “granite state” and one is not surprised to come across stone piles
    while walking in the woods. Some are clearly the remains of long-abandoned farms. 
    Others, located on land that no one would ever farm or built with 
    obvious design, seem more mysterious. Are they clearing piles left 
    behind on long-abandoned farms? Are they burial sites for early 
    colonists? Or are these the remains of Native American ceremonial sites?
  </p>
  <p>
    Our goal in NEARA is to
    document and preserve as many of these sites as possible until such 
    time as we can determine their origins and functions. Please help us 
    preserve them by reporting them to NEARA and by leaving them intact.
