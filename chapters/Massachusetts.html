  <p>
    Many of the sites described in Mavor and Dix’s seminal book on New England 
    ritual landscapes can be found in Massachusetts. These include the Upton
    Chamber, Boxboro esker, and Nashoba praying village. Massachusetts is 
    also home to one of the most debated petroglyph boulders in New England,
    Dighton Rock, as well as the enigmatic engraving of a sword hilt 
    ascribed to “The Westford Knight”. In spite of centuries of urban 
    development, old stone chambers, configurations of stone cairns, and 
    winding stone walls are still being discovered off the beaten track, 
    leaving us with many curious artifacts to ponder.
  </p>
  
  <h3>A Brief Overview of Massachusetts</h3>
  <p>
    The Massachusetts landscape was carved 
    out by glaciers during the last ice age. When the glaciers retreated 
    around ten thousand years ago, they left behind heaps of stone debris, 
    long ridges, huge erratics, and broad drumlins.
  </p>
  <p>
    We know that Native Americans were 
    building with stone here as early as 5000 years ago; a salvage 
    excavation of a rock shelter in Marlborough revealed a stone wall 15 
    feet long and 2 feet high, framing the base of a winter habitation site 
    beneath the overhanging ridge. Pre-Columbian Indians used controlled 
    burns to manage woodland and often kept some hills cleared of trees 
    altogether. Thus, when Europeans arrived in the 1600’s, they found a 
    familiar landscape with parkland, stone walls, and agricultural fields.
  </p>
  <p>
    Disease, war and persecution decimated 
    New England’s Indian population, resulting in the loss of much local 
    knowledge of Native American stonework. Although old accounts describe 
    the Indians’ use of stone chambers as sweat lodges and mention their 
    construction of stone and stick piles to honor a spirit or ancestor, by 
    the late twentieth century it was commonly assumed that New England’s 
    aborigines “did not build in stone.” Stone chambers were 
    simply designated as root cellars or ice houses and stone piles 
    dismissed as farm clearing piles. It took two Massachusetts residents, 
    James Mavor and Byron Dix, to rethink such structures as the remnants of
    a vast ritual landscape. Their 1989 book, Manitou, makes a compelling 
    case that New England’s Native Americans employed stone for a variety of
    purposes, including even astronomy. Support for this interpretation has
    been growing, exemplified by a 2009 finding by the federal government 
    that a stone site near the Turners Falls Airport once served as a sacred
    ceremonial hill, eligible for inclusion on the National Register of 
    Historic Places.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some writers, seeing a similarity 
    between the stone chambers in New England and Britain, have speculated 
    that pre-Columbian Celtic contact must be responsible. 
    Others are convinced that Vikings made it to Massachusetts shores; in 
    fact, there is a stone tower in Waltham commemorating Lief Erikson’s 
    discovery of the Charles River in 1000 A.D.! Engravings of a sword and 
    boat found in Westford have been taken as evidence of a 14<sup>th</sup> 
    century voyage by Scottish earl Henry Sinclair, while enigmatic carvings
    on a boulder in the Taunton River have been ascribed to early 
    Portuguese navigators and even Phoenicians.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Upton Chamber</h3>

  <img src="Massachusetts/upton-chamber-drawing.webp" alt="upton chamber diagram">
  <p>
    Few structures in Massachusetts have generated as much controversy as the 
    Upton Chamber. Nestled in a valley near Upton’s Pratt Pond, the 
    chamber’s narrow 15-foot
    long tunnel leads to a domed room 10 feet wide and 10 feet high. The 
    beehive architecture so resembles that of Irish monastic cells that 
    William Goodwin featured it in his 1946 book as evidence for a 
    pre-Columbian settlement of Culdee monks. Mavor and Dix suspected a 
    Native American origin and noted that horizon features on a facing hill 
    set up visual alignments marking the summer solstice sunset and the 
    heliacal setting of the Pleiades. Those favoring a colonial 
    interpretation point to historical records showing that a tannery once 
    existed not far from the site. Archaeological studies have thus far 
    yielded few clues. Fortunately, thanks to the efforts of the Upton 
    Historical Commission, the area surrounding the chamber has been 
    preserved as a park, and perhaps someday its true origins and purpose 
    may yet be determined.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Dighton Rock</h3>
  <img src="Massachusetts/pa_dighton_anthro.webp" alt="dighton anthro">
  <p>
    Like the Upton Chamber, the engraved boulder that once greeted travelers 
    coming up the Taunton River, has generated many diverse interpretations.
    Chisled into the stone, one can recognize animal and humanoid forms 
    among more abstract designs resembling X’s and diamonds. Some see Roman 
    numerals, dates, and even a Portuguese coat of arms among the 
    engravings, and it is quite likely that inscriptions were added at 
    multiple times over the centuries. But based upon similarities to other 
    Native American petroglyphs, most, if not all of the figures probably 
    have an indigenous origin.

  <h3>Foxboro “Prayer Seats”</h3>
  <img src="Massachusetts/pa_foxboro_small_u.webp" alt="foxboro small u">
  <img src="Massachusetts/pa_foxboro_large_u.webp" alt="foxboro large u">
  <p>
    Scattered about the Foxboro State Forest are a number of U-shaped stone 
    configurations. Elsewhere in the Americas, similar enclosures have been 
    identified as Indian prayer seats, sites where an individual or group 
    might go to seek a vision or observe the heavens. Those in Foxboro range
    in size from a small U that can fit one person to a massive structure 
    that could accommodate a dozen.

  <h3>King Philip’s Cave</h3>
  <img src="Massachusetts/pa_kpc_winter_sunset.webp" alt="kpc winter sunset">
  <p>
    Located on conservation land in Sharon, King Philip’s Cave is a natural cluster
    of large boulders with two unusual properties. From the center of the 
    cave, one can observe the summer solstice sun set on the horizon through
    a narrow stone aperture created by what appears to be a worked slab. 
    From the same spot, one can observe a dagger of light disappear into 
    another crevice on the winter solstice. Historically, the area was known
    as an important Indian site. “King Philip” was the English name for 
    Metacomet, the Indian chief who led the ill-fated uprising against 
    colonial invaders in 1675. One can only wonder whether the astronomical 
    properties of the cave were recognized and utilized by the Indians, for 
    whom the solstices were significant events and celebrated by ritual.

  <h3>Middleborough Hand Rock and other Hand Petroglyphs</h3>
  <img src="Massachusetts/pa_hand_rock_boulder.webp" alt="hand rock boulder">
  <img src="Massachusetts/pa_hand_rock_hand.webp" alt="hand rock hand">
  <p>
    The Middleborough area has a number of contact period petroglyphs, many 
    comprising life sized hand prints pecked into boulders or bedrock. 
    Perhaps this was a way of marking ownership of the property. A 
    description by Nehemiah Bennett dated 1793 mentions "a rock on a high 
    hill a little to the eastward of the old stone fishing weir, where there
    is the print of a person's hand in said rock". [Massachusetts 
    Historical Collections Vol. 3d 1810]. According to local legend, during 
    the King Philip’s War, an Indian who was taunting the English at a 
    nearby garrison was shot and killed at the boulder. The handprint was 
    supposedly left as the dying Indian’s hand struck the stone. The carving
    may have been “enhanced” in the 1930’s to make the outline deeper, so 
    we don’t know if the curved wrist and lines on the palm were in the 
    original engraving.

  <h3>Boxboro Solstice site</h3>
  <img src="Massachusetts/pa_boxboro_winter_sunrise.webp" alt="boxboro winter sunrise">
  <p>
    A resident of Boxboro, Manitou co-author Byron Dix predicted that the 
    winter solstice sun would rise above an animal shaped boulder when 
    viewed from a stone platform within a wall on the far side of a field. 
    His prediction was verified when the midwinter sun did indeed appear in a
    v-shaped notch in the effigy boulder. The site is now under the 
    protection of the Sudbury Valley Trustees and neighbor and NEARA member 
    George Krusen offers a morning sunrise tour there every December. 
    Curiously, a stone cairn visible from the same viewing point serves as a
    horizon marker for the summer solstice sunrise.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Wildcat Hill Cairns</h3>
  <img src="Massachusetts/pa_wildcat_cairns.webp" alt="wildcat cairns">
  <p>
    Stone pile sites can be found all over Massachusetts. In some cases, 
    the stones are carefully arranged on top of exposed boulders. In 
    others, they appear loosely piled on the ground. Often, they are 
    found in large clusters of similar appearance. While some may be 
    the result of field clearance, many are found in areas so rocky that 
    “field clearing” would have been futile. There are some early New 
    England accounts of Indians building "donation piles", in which 
    travelers add a stone or stick to a pile to honor an ancestor or local 
    spirit. Elsewhere, stone piles are associated with vision 
    quests. Wildcat Hill, located in Ashland not far from one of John 
    Elliot’s praying villages, may have comprised a ritual landscape with 
    upwards of a hundred devotional cairns, all on the west slope of the 
    hill. If you visit a stone pile site, enjoy the ambience and take care 
    not to disturb any of the rock formations, which contemporary Native 
    Americans believe still carry prayers to Mother Earth.

  <h3>Westford Knight and Boatstone</h3>
  <img src="Massachusetts/pa_westford_hilt.webp" alt="westford hilt">
  <img src="Massachusetts/pa_westford_boatstone.webp" alt="westford boatstone">
  <p>
    Pecked in the bedrock close to the center of Westford is what appears to be 
    the hilt of a sword. It is claimed that the outline of a knight with 
    shield and sword was once visible here, although natural striations in 
    the bedrock might have accounted for much of the image. Known as the 
    “Westford Knight”, some relate the carving to an account of a sea voyage
    taken by Scottish earl Henry Sinclair in the 14<sup>th</sup> century. 
    Adding to the mystery is a carving of a sailing ship, arrow and what 
    appear to be numbers on a small stone, now housed in the Westford 
    Library.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Nashoba Brook Stone Chamber</h3>
  <img src="Massachusetts/pa_acton_chamber.webp" alt="acton chamber">
  <img src="Massachusetts/pa_acton_spring_hill.webp" alt="acton spring hill">
  <p>
    Known locally as the “Acton Potato Cave”, this recently restored stone 
    chamber may have been utilized as a root cellar. It may also have had a 
    previous life as an Indian ritual chamber. The underground cell is one 
    stop along the “Trail Through Time”, a heritage trail connecting up both
    colonial and Native American sites which include an old mill, pencil 
    factory, and a large cluster of Indian stone piles. The 
    close proximity, overlap, and reuse of diverse cultural artifacts is 
    typical of the Massachusetts landscape, and one of the reasons that the 
    origins of many of the state’s unusual lithic features remain a mystery.
