    <span class="text">
      <p>
        Terry J. Deveau works for Jasco Applied Sciences as Senior Scientist – Ocean Acoustics.
        He graduated from Penn State University with an MS in Acoustics in 1999.
        His specialty is computer models of underwater sound.
        He has been employed in scientific software development since his university undergraduate days in 1974, and in the past has worked
        for Unysis, MacDonald Dettwiler, and the Government of Canada.
        He also has a BSc in mathematics, a diploma in engineering, and has done work at the graduate level in astrophysics.
        Terry has taught object-oriented computer programming at the university level.
        Terry served as NEARA president for six years (2012-04-21 to 2018-04-18) and is now serving NEARA as 2nd Vice-President
        and Chapter Coordinator for Atlantic Canada.
        He also serves with the NEARA editorial team on the publications committee and assists with website development.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his spare time, Terry has been a life-long student of history, geology, archaeology, mathematics, physics, and astronomy.
        He is active in exploring and investigating unusual stone structures and petroglyphs in remote areas of the Northeast,
        but especially his home Province of Nova Scotia, Canada.
        Terry's French Acadian ancestors have lived in Acadia (now the Maritime Provinces of Canada) since about 1690.
        Their stories, genealogy, and Acadian history in general are a particular passion for Terry.
        He also has a great interest in the records (oral, written, stone-built, and archaeological) of the early people of the Northeast,
        including the indigenous native people as well as those who came here from distant lands (British, French, Portuguese, Basque, and Norse).
        Terry has appeared in the role of historical consultant on the reality TV series “Curse of Oak Island” on a number of occasions,
        as well as on a CBC documentary program
        <a href="https://www.telltale.tv/shows/maritime-vignettes/stories-stone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Land and Sea</i></a> about the Yarmouth Runic Stone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Terry is active in the exploration, documentation, and preservation of ancient stone and earthwork structures in the Northeast,
        particularly those that are not presently adequately understood or documented.
        Although he has undertaken such projects in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, PEI, Newfoundland, and Labrador,
        his main activities are focused in his home province of Nova Scotia.
        His biggest project to-date is the archaeological recognizance survey of the Chain Lakes Watershed, which includes the Bayer's Lake Mystery Walls.

        After finding an interesting rock pile on his own in the woods, Walter learned about NEARA from a friend, George Krusen.
        Later he was shocked to find out that he had been running on a trail past a visible cairn field two or three times a week for years,
        without ever noticing those nicely shaped structures.

    <span class="text">
      <p>
        Although Susan Blackstone is not a native Vermonter, she has spent most of her adult life in the far northeast hills of Vermont and
        likes to refer to herself as a transplant.
        She came to Vermont in the 70's as part of the “Back to the Land Movement”.
        She studied video production, acting, and photography in college and had a professional background in sales and marketing within the publishing industry
        before becoming interested in holistic healing modalities.
        She is a Nationally Certified Reflexologist and Teacher and operates a small holistic center and Airbnb out of her home in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont.
        She is currently the Vermont State Coordinator and an active member of the NEARA Library Committee.
      </p>
      <p>
        Susan was first introduced to the mysterious concept of an Ancient Vermont in the early 80's when some friends showed her photographs
        of standing stones and stone chambers around central Vermont.
        After visiting a stone chamber known as Calendar Two “It was love at first site” and she was determined to learn more about this fascinating subject.
        While working for the American Society of Dowsers she discovered a copy of the NEARA Transit at their bookstore
        and contacted the then chapter coordinator, Lisa Gannon.
        Lisa was leading some summer field trips at the time and introduced her to an old time NEARA Member Ernie Clifford.
        Susan had the opportunity to visit many lesser known sites around central Vermont with Ernie and Lisa and attended her first
        NEARA Conference in New Hampshire in 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the past year, Susan has been working on organizing the NEARA VT files by county and matching up old site reports with new and updated materials.
        She has also been active in working on the library database and familiarizing herself with the NEARA Library's unusual and unique contents.
        She is an avid travel photographer with a keen interest in Ancient Civilizations.
        She is working on a photo journal of her many trips to the megalithic sites she has visited in Mexico, Aruba, the UK, India, and Egypt.
        Her plans for the NEARA Vermont Chapter are to arrange small field trips this summer and fall to some of the lesser known sites around the state.
        She is also interested in engaging her chapter members by means of online meetings.
        She is honored to serve NEARA as the Vermont Chapter Coordinator and is looking forward to a more socially interactive year ahead.

      <p>
        Devon Toland is a fabricator/welder/machinist who works with all kinds of metals, and makes a wide array of different products for various fields.
        From art, to structural components, railings, staircases, furniture, signs, countertops, and more for residential, commercial, medical, and food grade requirements.
        He was born and raised in Seacoast, NH, and has always enjoyed getting out to enjoy nature whether it be hiking, fishing, boating, target shooting, or riding one of his motorcycles.
        Devon and his wife Kelly, have been exploring New England and beyond since 2015 in their spare time.
        They make an effort to visit some of the less seen sites, such as waterfalls, plane crashes, mines, abandoned military installations, stone structures, and ghost towns.
      </p>
      <p>
        In June/July of 2023 Devon and Kelly took a trip out west to explore some of the usual tourist stops, as well as getting to see lots of ancient indigenous sites in California and Nevada.
        They visited the curious stonework of Tomales Point on the coast, carvings and immense walls of petroglyphs in remote desert canyons,
        and fascinating archaeological discoveries sometimes right on the side of the interstate.
        While in the desert of Nevada, the two went up towards Pyramid Lake into the Paiute tribal lands and talked with some of the people in order to visit some of the oldest petroglyphs in the country.
        At the end of their conversation, the elders' decision was to not allow anyone to visit the petroglyphs.
        Scientists, archaeologists, and even many members of the tribe are not allowed to visit them under any circumstances.
        While disappointing to hear, Devon and Kelly’s first priority is protecting, and respecting these amazing windows into time that have survived the elements as well as human interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Devon has spent lots of time scouring the extensive NEARA Site DB since joining in early 2023 and will be working with fellow members to add, contribute to, and clarify sites.
        While interested in the digital and written resources available, his passion is getting in the woods and experiencing what the state has to offer overall,
        as well as sharing that with other individuals who have common interests.

    <img class="portrait" src="/bios/ROB BUCHANAN PHOTO.jpg">
    <span class="text">
      <p>
        Rob Buchanan first became interested in stone structures through
        reading an article in a local newspaper about the stone chambers
        in Putnam County NY and the debate as to their origin. He then
        found out about and joined NEARA. He has been a member for over
        20 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once he learned about the other kinds of structures that NEARA
        is interested in, Rob realized he had seen many such structures
        in the woods through his involvement in the sport of
        orienteering.
        In 1994 Rob was the NY State Orienteering Champion in his age
        group and in 1993 was ranked in the top ten in his age group in
        the US.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rob has used detailed topographic orienteering maps to find many
        astounding stone features and stone landscapes.
        Through his company Rambler Maps Rob produces both orienteering
        maps and maps of stone features and landscapes.
        At the Spring 2012 Conference in Concord NH Rob presented a
        workshop on using orienteering maps to find stone features. This
        workshop culminated in a field trip to Fox State Forest where
        participants used an orienteering map to find cairn clusters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rob has led many other conference and local NEARA field trips
        and also has given presentations at NEARA conferences.
        Rob has also written articles for The Transit and the Rock Piles
        blog. He is also a regular contributor to the many Facebook
        groups that focus on the Native American Stone Structures of the
        Northeast. Rob also hosts a Facebook group called Lithic World.
        Rob is currently the NEARA Treasurer and was also a Director-at-
        Large for many years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before retiring in 2022 Rob worked for over 40 years as a
        Litigation Paralegal. Currently Rob works as an outdoor educator
        facilitating team building and group problem solving activities
        for groups of elementary through to high school students.

        Recently retired from a 33-year career as a Wildlife Biologist/Ecologist managing a system of nature preserves across New Jersey,
        Martin has now focused his attention on locating Ceremonial Stone Landscapes in New Jersey.
        He works closely with the Ramapough Lenape Nation Turtle Clan and the NJ State Historic Preservation Office in this endeavor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Involved with NEARA since 2017, he has identified dozens of locations in New Jersey of cairn fields both big and small,
        stone serpents, chambers and a whole lot more.
        Martin has provided short summaries of some of his finding at NEARA conferences and made two Zoom presentations
        at the 2021 fall NEARA conference: on using LiDAR to find sites and on two stone chambers.

        Frederick W. Martin earned his doctorate in physics at Yale University in 1964.
        After a stint in commercial semiconductor research, he served at universities located in Europe, Kentucky, and Maryland where
        he taught classes and led research into atomic collisions at high velocities funded by the National Science Foundation.
        Subsequently he founded two small research companies using such collisions in microscopy,
        leading to more NSF support, patents, more publications, and a specialized lens sold worldwide before retirement in 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1975 he read the works of the British professor Alexander Thom, especially his book Megalithic Lunar Observatories,
        and began fieldwork in archaeology as an avocation.
        Like Byron Dix, he set out to find stone remains in New England.
        With wife Beppy and young children he made many weekend visits to walking sites with names retaining the Puritan association
        of Native American meeting places with devil worship, or with the name of the Wampanoag tribe leader “King Philip.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This led to much work on King Philip's Rocks in Sharon MA, including a GPS survey with the town conservation agent,
        an early oral report at the NEARA 2001 Fall Meeting, preservation of 150 acres by town meeting votes,
        two articles in the Bulletin of the Massachusetts Archaeological Society with Ted Ballard and Jim Mavor,
        another oral report on the Archaic date of the site (by Lockyer's method) at a combined NEARA/MAS meeting,
        and a certificate of appreciation from the Sharon Friends of Conservation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first NEARA report led to published work with Polly Midgley, Beppy Martin, and Walter Wheeler on the possible sightings of the setting sun and
        moon as seen from the semicircular plaza in front of the Kings Chamber in Putnam Valley NY.
        Realization of the opportunity to do OSL dating during repair of the Upton Chamber for public safety reasons led to published work with Cathy Taylor
        which proved for the first time that a chamber was constructed prior to European settlement.
        Much more still unpublished work on sightlines at the Balanced Rock in Canton MA, which face southwards where the moon cannot rise,
        has led to identification of sightlines to the ends of the Milky Way on the horizon, both at Canton and larger sites such as Newark, Ohio,
        Lizard Mounds, Wisconsin, and Chimney Rock, Colorado.

        Nancy Berke was introduced to NEARA when attending the annual American Society of Dowsers conferences in Vermont.
        She found that her curiosity about archaeoastronomy, earth mysteries, earth energies, and
        stone circle sites was shared by members of an interesting organization called NEARA.
        Members of ASD and NEARA were similarly intrigued by the compelling research being done at local calendar sites,
        specifically Calendar One, Calendar Two, and America's Stonehenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having been drawn to the study of megalithic sites in Europe, it was joining NEARA in 2006 that served to expand
        Nancy's horizons in a number of fascinating areas including:
        ancient civilizations and ancient sea peoples; early trans-oceanic travel and exploration; archaeoacoustics of stone age temples of Malta;
        the theory of diffusionist culture; the Solutrean hypothesis; Viking exploration in North America;
        the mound builders of the mid-west and earthwork remnants that remain such as Cahokia and Serpent Mound; and
        the pervasive rock piles, standing stones, chambers and propped boulders of New England with their similarities to lithic structures throughout the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nancy became a Director-at-Large in 2007 and her primary contributions to NEARA have been as Conference Book Table Coordinator
        and member/Chairperson of the Library and Archives Committee.
        Since 2015, she has been closely involved with the relocation and reorganization of the Library as well as with the creation of
        a new online database for the book collection.
        Nancy is always happy to meet members at the Library in Nashua, NH to help facilitate the borrowing and purchasing of books.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being involved with the Library and the Book Table for 14 years has allowed her to recognize and appreciate the wide-ranging interests of the NEARA membership.
        She values the members' unique perspectives of focus and study in the realm of antiquity, both historic and Neolithic,
        and enjoys learning from them about the enigmatic stone structures which provide the thread that binds their interests together.

        David Brody is the author of 13 novels, most of which focus on sites and artifacts in New England evidencing exploration of America before Columbus.
        He has appeared as a guest expert on documentaries airing on History Channel, Discovery, Travel Channel, PBS, and the Science Channel.
        A graduate of Tufts University and Georgetown Law School, David first served on the NEARA Board in 2007-2010 and has now returned for a second term.
      </p>
      <p>
        A longtime resident of Westford, Massachusetts, David first joined NEARA in 2006 as a result of his interest in the Westford Knight
        and Westford Boat Stone carvings.
        His children call him a “rock nerd” because of the time he spends exploring stone carvings and chambers around New England.
        One of his favorite locations is America's Stonehenge, where you can often find him on solstice and equinox sunrises and sunsets
        observing the various astronomical alignments.
        You can also be sure to find him at the Newport Tower on the morning of the winter solstice observing the fascinating “keystone orb”
        illumination—he has not missed this event in 13 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        David now resides in Newburyport Massachusetts with his wife, sculptor Kimberly Scott.
        He spends much of his time traveling the country and visiting Europe to view ancient megalithic sites, which he then incorporates into his novels.
        These novels tend to focus on one key question: Did ancient peoples visit America before Columbus?
        It is a question that keeps David—and many other NEARA members—up at night.

        Dave Gutkowski is a successful storage business owner, licensed private pilot, licensed massage therapist,
        accomplished Reiki master, and amateur astronomer from Ashley, PA.
        He attended Bishop Hoban High School and Penn State University where he studied Mechanical Engineering.
        Upon graduation Dave took a job with the US Postal Service, and during his 30-year career worked every job available in order to continue learning.
        Dave officially retired from the USPS in 2009 as postmaster of Shawanese, PA where he met his partner Carla.
      </p>
      <p>
        After discovering a curiously arranged collection of large boulders on a mountaintop meadow in 2004 Dave's interest in stone landscapes was born.
        He felt drawn to the boulders he called ‘Council Rocks' and joined NEARA in 2007.
        That year, and with the help of veteran member Fred Martin, he found the uniquely shaped boulders to be perfectly aligned with both solstice and equinox events.
        Using his astronomy background, he successfully researched, documented and established the site as a potential late-archaic
        archaeoastronomy site with the PA Historic Preservation Office.
        He was awarded an official site designation from the SHPO in 2011 and presented his findings on Council Rocks at a NEARA conference in 2012.
        He continues his research at the Council Rocks site and nearby Alpenglow Rockshelter for which he also received a site designation from the SHPO in 2019.
        Dave was invited to serve on the NEARA board and as PA Coordinator in 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dave and Carla currently reside in Bear Creek, PA surrounded by pets and wildlife and have been known to hand-feed visiting raccoons and white-tailed deer.
        They love hiking and nature photography.
        His work over the past decade has led to giving presentations on both sites at numerous archaeology conferences in PA, NY, and VA,
        as well as meetings for avocational groups within the region and at the AAPS annual meetings in Michigan.
        Recent work on the mountain includes large area LiDAR scans and ground-penetrating radar scans at the rockshelter.
        Both have produced even more sites and findings of interest.
        He hopes to bring his decades of learning and astronomy skills to help research and further document alignments for many long-standing NEARA projects.

      <p>
        Over the past ten years Jim's interest in indigenous lithic creations became a passion.
        Dr. Curtis Hoffman's research project of indigenous lithic stone sites along the eastern seaboard propelled Jim to search for and record the same
        in his hometown of Hopkinton, MA and his family home in Denning, NY.
        Jim's efforts to protect indigenous lithic sites forged collaborations with Doug Harris the recently retired Deputy Tribal Historic Preservation Officer,
        Cathy Taylor the Steward of Upton, MA Chamber & Narragansett Indian Tribal Historic Preservation Trust, and Eva Gibavic of Ceremonial Landscapes Research LLC.
        Jim co-hosted two Ceremonial Stone Landscape presentations for the Hopkinton Public Library and the Hopkinton Historical Society with Doug Harris.
        Jim and Doug Harris worked with the Hopkinton Planning Board to ensure that a solar company protected Ceremonial Stone features,

        professional certifications and registrations.
        </p>
      <p>
        Gary has extensive experience in conducting site reconnaissance surveys, research, and systematic environmental site investigations.
        These have involved abandoned and complex tracts requiring historical research into ownership, land use practices, identification of
        soil and artificial fill characteristics, use of remote sensing imagery and surficial and bedrock geology.
        For projects investigating human-caused impacts and natural alterations of a site, he values phased systematic approaches that
        examine and integrate multiple factors that contribute to the environmental and cultural setting under review.
        He also has experience in the application of field investigation techniques involving nonintrusive and intrusive subsurface investigations,
        collection and handling of soil samples, geophysical techniques, and selection of laboratory methods.

        During these various excursions, he appreciates the exchange of insights of encountered observations of unusual, weathered boulder
        arrangements, geologic features and natural formations that suggest patterns of historical cultural adaptation and use.
        Gary is an avid explorer of interesting natural environmental and geologic landforms and their spatial geographic interrelationships
        with past human activity.
        In particular, he focuses on the investigation of modified landform features and crafted structural stonework formations in landscapes
        that strongly suggest a venerated purpose and intended design by ancient indigenous builders.
        A few years ago, during research of a particular curious observation, he noticed a reference to NEARA in a publication.
        He subsequently joined as a result because he wanted to volunteer in an organization with a meaningful vision and expand his
        participation into the research of ancient periods, mysterious relics, and existence of diverse indigenous roots of the
        northeast/mid-Atlantic areas.
        As such, Gary is drawn to the mystery and intent of past cultures to express complex harmonious relationships with nature and
        integrate belief systems around natural stone features and crafted lithic structures.

        While Anne Marie has been wandering the forests of western Massachusetts for more than 5 decades,
        she has only recently applied field skills to the practice of locating and documenting sites that
        contain unusual stone features some of which may someday be dated to confirm the pre- or post-settlement origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anne Marie has been a NEARA member since 2020, a Director at large since 2022, and currently serves as
        President of NEARA and Editor of the NEARA Journal. During the fall of 2021 Anne Marie volunteered to
        assist NEARA's OSL dating projects in 3 locations in New Hampshire and in 2023 she assisted with
        ground truth field surveys (GPS) of stone Niche solar orientation in Connecticut's New Haven Co.,
        Hartford Co. and Tolland Co., CT and photography of the newly discovered Equinox solar alignment at
        Gungywamp Chamber #2 and New London Co. CT.  Anne Marie was a speaker during the Spring 2021 and
        Fall 2022 NEARA conferences and led 2 NEARA field trips to sites in western Massachusetts associated
        with the Fall 2022 Conference held in Brattleboro Vermont. Anne Marie is currently assisting with an
        interdisciplinary Archaeo-botanical database query of fossil pollen to date the introduction of
        European plant species in New England.
      </p>

        Betsy is a retired art educator and fine artist. She holds a BS from Skidmore College, and MFA from Syracuse University.
        Betsy taught art education, studio courses, and helped design and direct the Art Ed program at UVM.
        She taught in CT public schools and at CCSU, finishing up a rewarding 40+year career in 2008.
      </p>
      <p>
        Betsy joined NEARA in 1990 after she and her husband bought land on Onion Mtn Ridge in CT.
        The property faces Talcott Mtn ridge, has a year-round view of sunrises, and is dotted with dramatic boulders, outcroppings,
        stone piles, and alignments to Solstice & Equinox points across the valley.
        With the suggestion from a geologist friend “you must read Manitou!”, the Mavor/Dix book opened a new door in the awareness
        and appreciation of Ceremonial Stone Landscapes.
      </p>
      <p>
        At NEARA conferences, networking with members and speakers from many different disciplines, as well as joining field trips with state coordinators,
        Betsy believes NEARA offered compelling education and exposure to enigmatic sites and research, motivating her to get involved with
        a variety of projects and travel:  a summer at the Leon Levy Expedition in Ashkelon, Israel; an intensive trip with NEARA member and
        friend Zena Halpern covering the entire coast of Israel to visit ancient ports, museums, universities, and meeting with key archaeologists
        on site at their excavations; a trip to Petra guided by Brown University archaeologists, and a long trip with Ros Strong and Sue Carlson
        (past NEARA leaders) to visit ancient sites on the west coast of France, as well as Lascaux and other caves of the Dordogne.
        Betsy also engaged the staff at the Institute of Native American Studies in Washington, CT to work in collaboration with programs in her
        school district to bring important new speakers and learning to the students and faculty.
        Betsy is particularly proud of NEARA's associations and camaraderie with anthropologists and archaeologists at the Smithsonian,
        whose outstanding contributions to Conference programs fostered long lasting influence on research and NEARA archives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Betsy served as NEARA VP for two terms in the 2000s, with a focus on Conferences. She stepped away from full NEARA involvement in 2013
        but returned in 2021 with renewed interest in expanding NEARA's programs, outreach, and network.  Betsy was elected 1st VP,
        and will continue to coordinate conferences with a focus on venues that offer the qualities that conference speakers and attendees deserve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Betsy now lives on the CT shore.  When NEARA is not on the to-do list, she plans to re-establish her studio work,
        sail as often as possible, and travel to her bucket list locations.

        Teresa has been a NEARA Member since 2007.
        Living most of her life in Putnam County New York it is no wonder that her main area of interest and research has been Stone Chambers.
        She spent twelve years hiking through the woods and driving around the area “Chamber Hunting” then documenting her finds.
        Now that she is retired Teresa has the time to spend organizing her field notes, compiling her research, and databasing all the Stone Chambers she documented.
      </p>
      <p>
        In November 2019 Teresa and her husband John, along with their poodles Jack and Lucy, left the great northeast and moved to sunny Florida.
        She is still continually active in NEARA and found her new state to have a rich history of indigenous peoples.
        A famous archeological dig only a few miles from her home, The Old Vero Site, is the first on her list of interests with many other sites in the state to explore.
        Teresa is looking forward to this new and exciting adventure and will share her discoveries with NEARA Members as they unfold.

    <span class="text">
      <p>
        Todd Pfleger is a lifelong resident of New York State. He enjoys being in the great outdoors:
        kayaking, hiking and seeking landscapes to photograph. After retiring from a thirty-two-year career as
        an electrician at the United States Military Academy at West Point, Todd moved from the Hudson Valley
        with his partner, Sally, to a seven-acre property in the Catskill Mountains in Fleischmanns, New York.
      </p>
      <p>
        While searching for the property borders, Todd came across a series of interesting stone constructs in
        the wooded section of the property. Intrigued by the apparently purposeful placement of the constructions,
        Todd began researching their possible origins and significance. His research led him not only to many
        books on the subject, but to NEARA as well, where he enthusiastically joined the organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Todd has spent the last three years applying his skills and knowledge of reasoning, troubleshooting and
        deduction towards understanding the many intricacies surrounding the stone constructs on his, and adjoining
        properties, which he has since named Monument Ridge. Todd has become most fascinated with the
        archeoastronomical alignments and has utilized his photographic skills to document many of these occurrences.
        He also enjoys exploring other known and potential sites both locally and abroad looking for similarities
        and unique qualities between the sites to potentially offer a more thorough, holistic understanding of
        these sites additional to or other than what our current historical account in the northeastern U.S. represents.
        To such ends he has travelled to Egypt to take in the pyramids, (where he had the opportunity to enter into
        the King’s Chamber of the great Pyramid), tours of Greece and Italy to experience the many culturally
        significant sites each country has to offer, Malta to view Hagar Qim, amongst others, and is eagerly
        anticipating a trip to Easter Island in January of 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
        To document and bring forth the knowledge he has discovered, Todd is working on writing his first book
        detailing his numerous discoveries located at Monument Ridge.
        Todd is looking forward continuing to explore sites throughout New York State, and beyond, as the NEARA
        New York State Coordinator.
